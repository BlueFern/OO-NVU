abstract = {Neural activities trigger regional vasodilation in the brain. Diffusible messengers such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostanoids are considered to work as vasodilators in neurovascular coupling. However, their roles are still controversial. In the present study, cortical images of neural activities and vasodilation were recorded through the intact skull of C57BL/6 mice anesthetized with urethane. Flavoprotein fluorescence responses elicited by vibratory hindpaw stimulation were followed by darkening of arteriole images reflecting vasodilation in the somatosensory cortex. Vasodilation was also observed in light reflection images at the wavelength of 570 nm in the same mice. We perfused the surface of the cortex under the skull with 100 $\mu$M NG-nitro-l-arginine (l-NA), an inhibitor of NO synthase (NOS), and 10 $\mu$M indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX). These drugs suppressed vasodilation without changing flavoprotein fluorescence responses. A mixture of l-NA and indomethacin almost completely eliminated vasodilation. In mice lacking neuronal NOS (nNOS), activity-dependent vasodilation was significantly suppressed compared with that in littermate control mice, while that in mice lacking cytosolic phospholipase A2 $\alpha$ (cPLA2$\alpha$) was unchanged. These results indicate that NO works as a vasodilator in neurovascular coupling of the mouse somatosensory cortex. © 2007.},

Knowledge of how these cells control blood flow is crucial for understanding how neural computation is powered, for interpreting functional imaging scans of brains, and for developing treatments for neurological disorders. It is now recognized that neurotransmitter-mediated signalling has a key role in regulating cerebral blood flow, that much of this control is mediated by astrocytes, that oxygen modulates blood flow regulation, and that blood flow may be controlled by capillaries as well as by arterioles. These conceptual shifts in our understanding of cerebral blood flow control have important implications for the development of new therapeutic approaches.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are still the most frequent cause of death in Western Europe. Pathophysiological experiments revealed in the last years that the vascular endothelium, as well as a result of the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), is a crucial regulator of vascular function and homeostasis. The vascular endothelium plays a key role in cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology, largely via NO-dependent processes. L-Arginine is the substrate for the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) to generate NO. Endothelial dysfunction is caused by various cardiovascular risk factors. In most studies, acute and chronic administration of L-arginine has been shown to improve endothelial function in animal models of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Therefore, numerous studies have been conducted to elucidate whether dietary L-arginine supplementation can augment NO production in humans and thereby improve endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. The most likely mechanism that explains the occurrence of endothelial dysfunction and the effect of L-arginine is that application of L-arginine antagonizes asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), the endogenous NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor. This could solve the L-arginine paradox namely that L-arginine improves NO-mediated vascular function in vivo, although its baseline plasma concentration is about 25- to 30-fold higher than the Michaelis-Menten constant Km of the isolated, purified eNOS in vitro. Recent findings suggest that large, prospective, randomized clinical trials might be needed to identify those patients who are the most likely to benefit from L-arginine. Testing patients for ADMA and L-arginine plasma levels for calculating the L-arginine/ADMA ratio might be an adequate strategy.},

abstract = {Neuronal activity in the brain is thought to be coupled to cerebral arterioles (functional hyperemia) through Ca2+ signals in astrocytes. Although functional hyperemia occurs rapidly, within seconds, such rapid signaling has not been demonstrated in situ, and Ca2+ measurements in parenchymal arterioles are still lacking. Using a laser scanning confocal microscope and fluorescence Ca2+ indicators, we provide the first evidence that in a brain slice preparation, increased neuronal activity by electrical stimulation (ES) is rapidly signaled, within seconds, to cerebral arterioles and is associated with astrocytic Ca2+ waves. Smooth muscle cells in parenchymal arterioles exhibited Ca2+ and diameter oscillations ("vasomotion") that were rapidly suppressed by ES. The neuronal-mediated Ca2+ rise in cortical astrocytes was dependent on intracellular (inositol trisphosphate [IP3]) and extracellular voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel sources. The Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin prevented the rise in astrocytic [Ca2+]i and the suppression of Ca2+ oscillations in parenchymal arterioles to ES, indicating that neuronal activity was necessary for both events. Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors in astrocytes significantly decreased the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations in parenchymal arterioles. This study supports the concept that astrocytic Ca2+ changes signal the cerebral microvasculature and indicate the novel concept that this communication occurs through the suppression of arteriolar [Ca2+]i oscillations and corresponding vasomotion.

abstract = {Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a slow-moving ionic and metabolic disturbance that propagates in cortical brain tissue. In addition to massive cellular depolarizations, CSD also involves significant changes in perfusion and metabolism-aspects of CSD that had not been modeled and are important to traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and migraine. In this study, we develop a mathematical model for CSD where we focus on modeling the features essential to understanding the implications of neurovascular coupling during CSD. In our model, the sodium-potassium-ATPase, mainly responsible for ionic homeostasis and active during CSD, operates at a rate that is dependent on the supply of oxygen. The supply of oxygen is determined by modeling blood flow through a lumped vascular tree with an effective local vessel radius that is controlled by the extracellular potassium concentration. We show that during CSD, the metabolic demands of the cortex exceed the physiological limits placed on oxygen delivery, regardless of vascular constriction or dilation. However, vasoconstriction and vasodilation play important roles in the propagation of CSD and its recovery. Our model replicates the qualitative and quantitative behavior of CSD--vasoconstriction, oxygen depletion, extracellular potassium elevation, prolonged depolarization--found in experimental studies. We predict faster, longer duration CSD in vivo than in vitro due to the contribution of the vasculature. Our results also help explain some of the variability of CSD between species and even within the same animal. These results have clinical and translational implications, as they allow for more precise in vitro, in vivo, and in silico exploration of a phenomenon broadly relevant to neurological disease.},

abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays critical roles in the maintenance of central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis. Dysfunction of the BBB occurs in a number of CNS diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). A prevailing hypothesis in the AD field is the amyloid cascade hypothesis that states that amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) deposition in the CNS initiates a cascade of molecular events that cause neurodegeneration, leading to AD onset and progression. In this review, the participation of the BBB in the amyloid cascade and in other mechanisms of AD neurodegeneration will be discussed. We will specifically focus on three aspects of BBB dysfunction: disruption, perturbation of transporters, and secretion of neurotoxic substances by the BBB. We will also discuss the interaction of the BBB with components of the neurovascular unit in relation to AD and the potential contribution of AD risk factors to aspects of BBB dysfunction. From the results discussed herein, we conclude that BBB dysfunction contributes to AD through a number of mechanisms that could be initiated in the presence or absence of A$\beta$ pathology.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. In connection with the global trend of prolonging human life and the increasing number of elderly in the population, the AD becomes one of the most serious health and socioeconomic problems of the present. Tau protein promotes assembly and stabilizes microtubules, which contributes to the proper function of neuron. Alterations in the amount or the structure of tau protein can affect its role as a stabilizer of microtubules as well as some of the processes in which it is implicated. The molecular mechanisms governing tau aggregation are mainly represented by several posttranslational modifications that alter its structure and conformational state. Hence, abnormal phosphorylation and truncation of tau protein have gained attention as key mechanisms that become tau protein in a pathological entity. Evidences about the clinicopathological significance of phosphorylated and truncated tau have been documented during the progression of AD as well as their capacity to exert cytotoxicity when expressed in cell and animal models. This paper describes the normal structure and function of tau protein and its major alterations during its pathological aggregation in AD.},

abstract = {The coupling between neuronal activity and cerebral blood flow (CBF) is essential for normal brain function. The mechanisms behind this neurovascular coupling process remain elusive, mainly because of difficulties in probing dynamically the functional and coordinated interaction between neurons and the vasculature in vivo. Direct and simultaneous measurements of nitric oxide (NO) dynamics and CBF changes in hippocampus in vivo support the notion that during glutamatergic activation nNOS-derived NO induces a time-, space-, and amplitude-coupled increase in the local CBF, later followed by a transient increase in local O2 tension. These events are dependent on the activation of the NMDA-glutamate receptor and nNOS, without a significant contribution of endothelial-derived NO or astrocyte-neuron signaling pathways. Upon diffusion of NO from active neurons, the vascular response encompasses the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase. Hence, in the hippocampus, neurovascular coupling is mediated by nNOS-derived NO via a diffusional connection between active glutamatergic neurons and blood vessels. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Neurovascular coupling is the well-documented link between neural stimulation and constriction or dilation of the surrounding vasculature. Glial cells mediate this response via their unique anatomy, which connects neurons to arterioles. It is believed that calcium transients and the release of secondary messengers by these cells influence the vascular response. We present a model of intracellular calcium dynamics in an astrocyte (glial cell) and show that stable oscillatory behaviour is possible under certain conditions. We then couple this to a novel model for the relationship between calcium concentration and the production of vasoactive secondary messengers through a fatty-acid intermediate. The two secondary messengers modelled are epoxyeicosatrienoic and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (EET and 20-HETE, respectively). These secondary messengers are produced on different time scales, and we show how this supports the observation that the vasculature dilates rapidly in response to neural stimulation, before returning to baseline levels on a slower time scale.},

Knowledge of how these cells control blood flow is crucial for understanding how neural computation is powered, for interpreting functional imaging scans of brains, and for developing treatments for neurological disorders. It is now recognized that neurotransmitter-mediated signalling has a key role in regulating cerebral blood flow, that much of this control is mediated by astrocytes, that oxygen modulates blood flow regulation, and that blood flow may be controlled by capillaries as well as by arterioles. These conceptual shifts in our understanding of cerebral blood flow control have important implications for the development of new therapeutic approaches.},

@article{Hamel2006,
abstract = {Brain perfusion is tightly coupled to neuronal activity, is commonly used to monitor normal or pathological brain function, and is a direct reflection of the interactions that occur between neuronal signals and blood vessels. Cerebral blood vessels at the surface and within the brain are surrounded by nerve fibers that originate, respectively, from peripheral nerve ganglia and intrinsic brain neurons. Although of different origin and targeting distinct vascular beds, these "perivascular nerves" fulfill similar roles related to cerebrovascular functions, a major one being to regulate their tone and, therein, brain perfusion. This utmost function, which underlies the signals used in functional neuroimaging techniques and which can be jeopardized in pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and migraine headache, is thus regulated at several levels. Recently, new insights into our understanding of how neural input regulate cerebrovascular tone resulted in the rediscovery of the functional "neurovascular unit." These remarkable advances suggest that neuron-driven changes in vascular tone result from interactions that involve all components of the neurovascular unit, transducing neuronal signals into vasomotor responses not only through direct interaction between neurons and vessels but also indirectly via the perivascular astrocytes. Neurovascular coupling is thus determined by chemical signals released from activated perivascular nerves and astrocytes that alter vascular tone to locally adjust perfusion to the spatial and temporal changes in brain activity.},

We demonstrate that the inflammatory activation of microglia serves as a key node for progressive neurodegeneration. Our analysis reveals that targeting microglia may hold potential promise in the prevention and treatment of AD.},

abstract = {S100B is an EF-hand calcium-binding protein that exerts both intracellular and extracellular effects on a variety of cellular processes. The protein is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system by astrocytes, both physiologically and during the course of neurological disease. In the healthy adult brain and during development, constitutive S100B expression acts as a trophic factor to drive neurite extension and to referee neuroplasticity. Yet, when induced during central nervous system disease, the protein can take on maladaptive roles and thereby exacerbate brain pathology. Based on genetic and pharmacological lines of evidence, we consider such deleterious roles of S100B in two common brain pathologies: ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In rodent models of ischemic brain damage, S100B is induced early on during the subacute phase, where it exacerbates gliosis and delayed infarct expansion and thereby worsens functional recovery. In mouse models of AD, S100B drives brain inflammation and gliosis that accelerate cerebral amyloidosis. Pharmacological inhibition of S100B synthesis mitigates hallmark pathologies of both brain diseases, opening the door for translational approaches to treat these devastating neurological disorders.},

abstract = {Moment-to-moment changes in local neuronal activity lead to dynamic changes in cerebral blood flow. Emerging evidence implicates astrocytes as one of the key players in coordinating this neurovascular coupling. Astrocytes are poised to sense glutamatergic synaptic activity over a large spatial domain via activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors and subsequent calcium signaling and via energy-dependent glutamate transport. Astrocyte foot processes can signal vascular smooth muscle by arachidonic acid pathways involving astrocytic cytochrome P450 epoxygenase, astrocytic cyclooxygenase-1 and smooth muscle cytochrome P450 omega-hydroxylase activities, and by astrocytic and smooth muscle potassium channels. Non-glutamatergic transmitters released from neurons, such as nitric oxide, cyclooxygenase-2 metabolites and vasoactive intestinal peptide, might modulate neurovascular signaling at the level of the astrocyte or smooth muscle. Thus, astrocytes have a pivotal role in dynamic signaling within the neurovascular unit. Important questions remain on how this signaling is integrated with other pathways in health and disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a risk factor for dementia. It is unknown whether higher glucose levels increase the risk of dementia in people without diabetes.

METHODS: We used 35,264 clinical measurements of glucose levels and 10,208 measurements of glycated hemoglobin levels from 2067 participants without dementia to examine the relationship between glucose levels and the risk of dementia. Participants were from the Adult Changes in Thought study and included 839 men and 1228 women whose mean age at baseline was 76 years; 232 participants had diabetes, and 1835 did not. We fit Cox regression models, stratified according to diabetes status and adjusted for age, sex, study cohort, educational level, level of exercise, blood pressure, and status with respect to coronary and cerebrovascular diseases, atrial fibrillation, smoking, and treatment for hypertension.

RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 6.8 years, dementia developed in 524 participants (74 with diabetes and 450 without). Among participants without diabetes, higher average glucose levels within the preceding 5 years were related to an increased risk of dementia (P=0.01); with a glucose level of 115 mg per deciliter (6.4 mmol per liter) as compared with 100 mg per deciliter (5.5 mmol per liter), the adjusted hazard ratio for dementia was 1.18 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 1.33). Among participants with diabetes, higher average glucose levels were also related to an increased risk of dementia (P=0.002); with a glucose level of 190 mg per deciliter (10.5 mmol per liter) as compared with 160 mg per deciliter (8.9 mmol per liter), the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.40 (95\% CI, 1.12 to 1.76).

CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that higher glucose levels may be a risk factor for dementia, even among persons without diabetes. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.)},

abstract = {The most fundamental aspect of the cerebral circulation is the well-described coupling of cerebral metabolic activity and cerebral blood flow. A number of substances have been proposed to link flow and metabolism, including K+, pH and adenosine. In the alpha-chloralose anaesthetised cat we studied simultaneously cerebral neuronal activity and local blood flow to attempt to dissociate the two and thus determine the coupling substance. Neuronal activity was determined by monitoring unit firing in the parietal cortex with tungsten in glass microelectrodes while local cerebral blood flow in the same area was monitored continuously using laser Doppler flowmetry. To initiate an increase in metabolic activity and, pari passu, blood flow spreading depression was elicited by needle stick injury. Spreading depression when initiated causes a wave of depolarization, measured as an increased firing rate and associated marked (400 +/- 95\%) increase in local cerebral blood flow. Intravenous administration of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (1-NAME), a potent nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, produced a complete blockade of the hyperemia associated with spreading depression but no change in either resting cell firing or spreading depression-evoked increases in firing rate. These data demonstrate at least for spreading depression-elicited increases in metabolic activity, that nitric oxide (NO) is a key coupling compound that links changes in cerebral blood flow and metabolism. These data imply that NO may have a more general role in flow/metabolism coupling and further studies in other situations are required to determine the extent to which NO is responsible for this fundamental cerebrovascular phenomenon.},

WIT003, ABSA and 20-HETE all had a similar effect to reduce the diameter of the middle cerebral artery by 26\%. WIT003 and 20-HETE both increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from the middle cerebral artery. In contrast, WIT002 had no effect on the basal diameter of the middle cerebral artery but it attenuated the vasoconstrictor responses and the rise in [Ca2+]i in vascular smooth muscle cells following administration of 20-HETE and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). WIT003 partially restored the vasoconstrictor response to 5-HT in the middle cerebral artery after administration of an inhibitor of the endogenous synthesis of 20-HETE. Infusion of the 20-HETE agonists, WIT003 and ABSA, into cisterna magna of rats reduced baseline cerebral blood flow by 20\%, whereas administration of the 20-HETE antagonist, WIT002, had no effect. Intracisternal injection of WIT002 attenuated the fall in cerebral blood flow following injection of blood into the cisterna magna, whereas administration of the 20-HETE agonist, ABSA, potentiated this response. These findings indicate that the 20-HETE agonists, WIT003 and ABSA, increase cerebral vascular tone both in vivo and in vitro and suggest blocking the vasoconstrictor actions of 20-HETE may be useful to prevent the acute fall in cerebral blood flow following subarachnoid hemorrhage.},

A wealth of investigations now shows that astrocytes actually participate in the control of synaptic transmission in an active manner. This was first hinted by the intimate contacts glial processes make with neurons, particularly at the synaptic level, and evidenced using electrophysiological and calcium imaging techniques. Calcium imaging has provided critical evidence demonstrating that astrocytic regulation of synaptic efficacy is not a passive phenomenon. However, given that cellular activation is not only represented by calcium signaling, it is also crucial to assess concomitant mechanisms. We and others have used electrophysiological techniques to simultaneously record neuronal and astrocytic activity, thus enabling the study of multiple ionic currents and in depth investigation of neuro-glial dialogues. In the current review, we focus on the input such approach has provided in the understanding of astrocyte-neuron interactions underlying control of synaptic efficacy.},

abstract = {Cell-cell communication in astroglial syncytia is mediated by intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) responses elicited by extracellular signaling molecules as well as by diverse physical and chemical stimuli. Despite the evidence that astrocytic swelling promotes [Ca(2+)](i) elevation through Ca(2+) influx, the molecular identity of the channel protein underlying this response is still elusive. Here we report that primary cultured cortical astrocytes express the transient receptor potential vanilloid-related channel 4 (TRPV 4), a Ca(2+)-permeable cation channel gated by a variety of stimuli, including cell swelling. Immunoblot and confocal microscopy analyses confirmed the presence of the channel protein and its localization in the plasma membrane. TRPV4 was functional because the selective TRPV4 agonist 4-alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4alphaPDD) activated an outwardly rectifying cation current with biophysical and pharmacological properties that overlapped those of recombinant human TRPV4 expressed in COS cells. Moreover, 4alphaPDD and hypotonic challenge promoted [Ca(2+)](i) elevation mediated by influx of extracellular Ca(2+). This effect was abolished by low micromolar concentration of the TRPV4 inhibitor Ruthenium Red. Immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy of rat brain revealed that TRPV4 was enriched in astrocytic processes of the superficial layers of the neocortex and in astrocyte end feet facing pia and blood vessels. Collectively, these data indicate that cultured cortical astroglia express functional TRPV4 channels. They also demonstrate that TRPV4 is particularly abundant in astrocytic membranes at the interface between brain and extracerebral liquid spaces. Consistent with its roles in other tissues, these results support the view that TRPV4 might participate in astroglial osmosensation and thus play a key role in brain volume homeostasis.},

abstract = {Neuronal activity in the brain is thought to be coupled to cerebral arterioles (functional hyperemia) through Ca2+ signals in astrocytes. Although functional hyperemia occurs rapidly, within seconds, such rapid signaling has not been demonstrated in situ, and Ca2+ measurements in parenchymal arterioles are still lacking. Using a laser scanning confocal microscope and fluorescence Ca2+ indicators, we provide the first evidence that in a brain slice preparation, increased neuronal activity by electrical stimulation (ES) is rapidly signaled, within seconds, to cerebral arterioles and is associated with astrocytic Ca2+ waves. Smooth muscle cells in parenchymal arterioles exhibited Ca2+ and diameter oscillations ("vasomotion") that were rapidly suppressed by ES. The neuronal-mediated Ca2+ rise in cortical astrocytes was dependent on intracellular (inositol trisphosphate [IP3]) and extracellular voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel sources. The Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin prevented the rise in astrocytic [Ca2+]i and the suppression of Ca2+ oscillations in parenchymal arterioles to ES, indicating that neuronal activity was necessary for both events. Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors in astrocytes significantly decreased the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations in parenchymal arterioles. This study supports the concept that astrocytic Ca2+ changes signal the cerebral microvasculature and indicate the novel concept that this communication occurs through the suppression of arteriolar [Ca2+]i oscillations and corresponding vasomotion.

abstract = {To detect nitric oxide (NO) in the rat brain during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was employed with the NO trapping technique, using an iron and N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC) complex. An X-band (about 9.5 GHz) EPR system detected a triplet signal (g = 2.038) derived from an NO-Fe-DETC complex being superimposed on the g(perpendicular) signal of Cu-DETC complex at liquid nitrogen temperature. The height of the triplet signal peaked seven hours after injection of 40 mg/kg of LPS, and over 25 x 10(4) U/kg of IFN-gamma enhanced the LPS-induced NO formation. Pretreatment with N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA), an NO synthase inhibitor, deleted only the triplet signal. A triplet signal (g(iso) = 2.040, aN = 1.28 mT) derived from the NO-Fe-DETC complex was also observed at ambient temperature. Then, a home-built 700 MHz EPR system was used to detect an NO signal in the septic rat brain in vivo. We successfully monitored the NO-Fe-DETC signal in the head region of a living rat under the condition that provided maximum height of the NO-Fe-DETC signal in the X-band EPR study. Pretreatment with NMMA again deleted the NO-Fe-DETC signal. This is the first EPR observation of endogenous NO in the brain of living rats.},

abstract = {Using interferometry-based biosensors the binding and release of endothelial and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (eNOS and nNOS) from calmodulin (CaM) was measured. In both isoforms, binding to CaM is diffusion limited and within approximately three orders of magnitude of the Smoluchowski limit imposed by orientation-independent collisions. This suggests that the orientation of CaM is facilitated by the charge arrays on the CaM-binding site and the complementary surface on CaM. Protein kinase C phosphorylation of eNOS T495, adjacent to the CaM-binding site, abolishes or greatly slows CaM binding. Kinases which increase the activity of eNOS did not stimulate the binding of CaM, which is already diffusion limited. The coupling of Ca(2+) binding and CaM/NOS binding equilibria links the affinity of CaM for NOS to the Ca(2+) dependence of CaM binding. Hence, changes in the Ca(2+) sensitivity of CaM binding always imply changes in the NOS-CaM affinity. It is possible, however, that in some regimes binding and activation are not synonymous, so that Ca(2+) sensitivity need not be tightly linked to CaM sensitivity of activation. This study is being extended using mutants to probe the roles of individual structural elements in binding and release.},

abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays critical roles in the maintenance of central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis. Dysfunction of the BBB occurs in a number of CNS diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). A prevailing hypothesis in the AD field is the amyloid cascade hypothesis that states that amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) deposition in the CNS initiates a cascade of molecular events that cause neurodegeneration, leading to AD onset and progression. In this review, the participation of the BBB in the amyloid cascade and in other mechanisms of AD neurodegeneration will be discussed. We will specifically focus on three aspects of BBB dysfunction: disruption, perturbation of transporters, and secretion of neurotoxic substances by the BBB. We will also discuss the interaction of the BBB with components of the neurovascular unit in relation to AD and the potential contribution of AD risk factors to aspects of BBB dysfunction. From the results discussed herein, we conclude that BBB dysfunction contributes to AD through a number of mechanisms that could be initiated in the presence or absence of A$\beta$ pathology.},

abstract = {Neuronal activity, astrocytic responses to this activity, and energy homeostasis are linked together during baseline, conscious conditions, and short-term rapid activation (as occurs with sensory or motor function). Nervous system energy homeostasis also varies during long-term physiological conditions (i.e., development and aging) and with adaptation to pathological conditions, such as ischemia or low glucose. Neuronal activation requires increased metabolism (i.e., ATP generation) which leads initially to substrate depletion, induction of a variety of signals for enhanced astrocytic function, and increased local blood flow and substrate delivery. Energy generation (particularly in mitochondria) and use during ATP hydrolysis also lead to considerable heat generation. The local increases in blood flow noted following neuronal activation can both enhance local substrate delivery but also provides a heat sink to help cool the brain and removal of waste by-products. In this review we highlight the interactions between short-term neuronal activity and energy metabolism with an emphasis on signals and factors regulating astrocyte function and substrate supply.},

abstract = {Recent epidemiological studies suggest that diabetes mellitus is a strong risk factor for Alzheimer disease. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, to investigate the pathophysiological interaction between these diseases, we generated animal models that reflect the pathologic conditions of both diseases. We crossed Alzheimer transgenic mice (APP23) with two types of diabetic mice (ob/ob and NSY mice), and analyzed their metabolic and brain pathology. The onset of diabetes exacerbated Alzheimer-like cognitive dysfunction without an increase in brain amyloid-beta burden in double-mutant (APP(+)-ob/ob) mice. Notably, APP(+)-ob/ob mice showed cerebrovascular inflammation and severe amyloid angiopathy. Conversely, the cross-bred mice showed an accelerated diabetic phenotype compared with ob/ob mice, suggesting that Alzheimer amyloid pathology could aggravate diabetes. Similarly, APP(+)-NSY fusion mice showed more severe glucose intolerance compared with diabetic NSY mice. Furthermore, high-fat diet feeding induced severe memory deficits in APP(+)-NSY mice without an increase in brain amyloid-beta load. Here, we created Alzheimer mouse models with early onset of cognitive dysfunction. Cerebrovascular changes and alteration in brain insulin signaling might play a pivotal role in this relationship. These findings could provide insights into this intensely debated association.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) catalyzes the oxidation of one l-arginine guanidinium N atom to nitric oxide (NO). NOS consists of a heme domain linked to a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)/flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) reductase that shuttles electrons from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to the heme. This review summarizes various aspects of NOS structure and function derived from crystal structures coupled with a wealth of biochemical and biophysical data. This includes the binding of diatomic ligands, especially the product, NO, whose binding to the heme iron blocks enzyme activity. An unusual feature of NOS catalysis is the strict requirement for the essential cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B). It now is generally agreed that H4B serves as an electron donor to the heme-oxy complex. The reason NOS may have recruited H4B as an electron transfer cofactor is to provide rapid coupled proton/electron transfer required for O2 activation. NOS is a highly regulated enzyme which is controlled by calmodulin (CaM) at the level of electron transfer within the FMN/FAD reductase and between the reductase and heme domains. Recent crystal structures provide a basis for developing models on the structural underpinnings of NOS regulation. In addition to the complex and fascinating functional and regulatory features of NOS, NOS is an important therapeutic target. Crystal structures have revealed the structural basis of isoform-selective inhibition by a group of dipeptide inhibitors which opens the way for structure-based inhibitor design.},

abstract = {A mathematical model of calcium dynamics in vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) was developed based on data mostly from rat mesenteric arterioles. The model focuses on (a) the plasma membrane electrophysiology; (b) Ca2+ uptake and release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR); (c) cytosolic balance of Ca2+, Na+, K+, and Cl ions; and (d) IP3 and cGMP formation in response to norepinephrine(NE) and nitric oxide (NO) stimulation. Stimulation with NE induced membrane depolarization and an intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) transient followed by a plateau. The plateau concentrations were mostly determined by the activation of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. NE causes a greater increase in [Ca2+]i than stimulation with KCl to equivalent depolarization. Model simulations suggest that the effect of[Na+]i accumulation on the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) can potentially account for this difference.Elevation of [Ca2+]i within a concentration window (150-300 nM) by NE or KCl initiated [Ca2+]i oscillations with a concentration-dependent period. The oscillations were generated by the nonlinear dynamics of Ca2+ release and refilling in the SR. NO repolarized the NE-stimulated SMC and restored low [Ca2+]i mainly through its effect on Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Under certain conditions, Na+-K+-ATPase inhibition can result in the elevation of [Na+]i and the reversal of NCX, increasing resting cytosolic and SR Ca2+ content, as well as reactivity to NE. Blockade of the NCX's reverse mode could eliminate these effects. We conclude that the integration of the selected cellular components yields a mathematical model that reproduces, satisfactorily, some of the established features of SMC physiology. Simulations suggest a potential role of intracellular Na+ in modulating Ca2+ dynamics and provide insights into the mechanisms of SMC constriction, relaxation, and the phenomenon of vasomotion. The model will provide the basis for the development of multi-cellular mathematical models that will investigate microcirculatory function in health and disease.},

abstract = {Increasing evidence supports a crucial role for glial metabolism in maintaining proper synaptic function and in the etiology of neurological disease. However, the study of glial metabolism in humans has been hampered by the lack of noninvasive methods. To specifically measure the contribution of astroglia to brain energy metabolism in humans, we used a novel noninvasive nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic approach. We measured carbon 13 incorporation into brain glutamate and glutamine in eight volunteers during an intravenous infusion of [2-13C] acetate, which has been shown in animal models to be metabolized specifically in astroglia. Mathematical modeling of the three established pathways for neurotransmitter glutamate repletion indicates that the glutamate/glutamine neurotransmitter cycle between astroglia and neurons (0.32 +/- 0.07 micromol x gm(-1) x min(-1)) is the major pathway for neuronal glutamate repletion and that the astroglial TCA cycle flux (0.14 +/- 0.06 micromol x gm(-1) x min(-1)) accounts for approximately 14\% of brain oxygen consumption. Up to 30\% of the glutamine transferred to the neurons by the cycle may derive from replacement of oxidized glutamate by anaplerosis. The further application of this approach could potentially enlighten the role of astroglia in supporting brain glutamatergic activity and in neurological and psychiatric disease.},

abstract = {Calcium modulates many neural processes, including synaptic plasticity and apoptosis. Dysregulation of intracellular calcium signalling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. Increased intracellular calcium elicits the characteristic lesions of this disorder, including the accumulation of amyloid-$\beta$, the hyperphosphorylation of TAU and neuronal death. Conversely, neurodegeneration that is induced by amyloid-$\beta$ or TAU is probably mediated by changes in calcium homeostasis. Disruption of calcium regulation in the endoplasmic reticulum mediates the most significant signal-transduction cascades that are associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Moreover, mutations that cause familial Alzheimer’s disease have been linked to intracellular calcium signalling pathways. Destabilization of calcium signalling seems to be central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease, and targeting this process might be therapeutically beneficial.},

In the vasculature NO is released by endothelial cells where it modulates the underlying smooth muscle to regulate vascular tone. Due to the unique chemistry of NO, such as its reactive and free radical nature, it can interact with many different cellular constituents such as thiols and transition metal ions, which determine its cellular actions. In this review we also discuss many of the useful pharmacological tools that have been developed and used extensively to establish the involvement of NO in endothelium-derived relaxations. In addition, the recent literature identifying a potential source of NO in endothelial cells, which is not directly derived from endothelial nitric oxide synthase is examined. Finally, the photorelaxation phenomena, which mediates the release of NO from a vascular smooth muscle NO store, is discussed.},

abstract = {Amyloid-$\beta$ interacts with two cell surface receptors, CD36 and CD47, through which the matricellular protein thrombospondin-1 inhibits soluble guanylate cyclase activation. Here we examine whether amyloid-$\beta$ shares this inhibitory activity. Amyloid-$\beta$ inhibited both drug and nitric oxide-mediated activation of soluble guanylate cyclase in several cell types. Known cGMP-dependent functional responses to nitric oxide in platelets and vascular smooth muscle cells were correspondingly inhibited by amyloid-$\beta$. Functional interaction of amyloid-$\beta$ with the scavenger receptor CD36 was indicated by inhibition of free fatty acid uptake via this receptor. Both soluble oligomer and fibrillar forms of amyloid-$\beta$ were active. In contrast, amyloid-$\beta$ did not compete with the known ligand SIRP$\alpha$ for binding to CD47. However, both receptors were necessary for amyloid-$\beta$ to inhibit cGMP accumulation. These data suggest that amyloid-$\beta$ interaction with CD36 induces a CD47-dependent signal that inhibits soluble guanylate cyclase activation. Combined with the pleiotropic effects of inhibiting free fatty acid transport via CD36, these data provides a molecular mechanism through which amyloid-$\beta$ can contribute to the nitric oxide signaling deficiencies associated with Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) is impaired following stroke. However, the relationship between dCA, brain atrophy, and functional outcomes following stroke remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine whether impairment of dCA is associated with atrophy in specific regions or globally, thereby affecting daily functions in stroke patients.We performed a retrospective analysis of 33 subjects with chronic infarctions in the middle cerebral artery territory, and 109 age-matched non-stroke subjects. dCA was assessed via the phase relationship between arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity. Brain tissue volumes were quantified from MRI. Functional status was assessed by gait speed, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), modified Rankin Scale, and NIH Stroke Score.Compared to the non-stroke group, stroke subjects showed degraded dCA bilaterally, and showed gray matter atrophy in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes ipsilateral to infarct. In stroke subjects, better dCA was associated with less temporal lobe gray matter atrophy on the infracted side ([Formula: see text] = 0.029), faster gait speed ([Formula: see text] = 0.018) and lower IADL score ([Formula: see text]0.002). Our results indicate that better dynamic cerebral perfusion regulation is associated with less atrophy and better long-term functional status in older adults with chronic ischemic infarctions.},

abstract = {Understanding the link between neuronal responses (NRs) and metabolic signals is fundamental to our knowledge of brain function and it is a milestone in our efforts to interpret data from modern non invasive optical techniques such as fMRI, which are based on the close coupling between metabolic demand of active neurons and local changes in blood flow. The challenge is to unravel the link. Here we show, using spectrophotometry to record oxyhaemoglobin and methemoglobin (surrogate markers of cerebral flow and nitric oxide levels respectively) together with extracellular neuronal recordings in vivo and applying a multiple polynomial regression model, that the markers are able to predict up about 80\% of variability in NR. Furthermore, we show that the coupling between blood flow and neuronal activity is heavily influenced by nitric oxide (NO). While NRs show the typical saturating response, blood flow shows a linear behaviour during contrast-response curves, with nitric oxide from different sources acting differently for low and high intensity.},

abstract = {Neuronal activity is thought to communicate to arterioles in the brain through astrocytic calcium (Ca(2+)) signaling to cause local vasodilation. Paradoxically, this communication may cause vasoconstriction in some cases. Here, we show that, regardless of the mechanism by which astrocytic endfoot Ca(2+) was elevated, modest increases in Ca(2+) induced dilation, whereas larger increases switched dilation to constriction. Large-conductance, Ca(2+)-sensitive potassium channels in astrocytic endfeet mediated a majority of the dilation and the entire vasoconstriction, implicating local extracellular K(+) as a vasoactive signal for both dilation and constriction. These results provide evidence for a unifying mechanism that explains the nature and apparent duality of the vascular response, showing that the degree and polarity of neurovascular coupling depends on astrocytic endfoot Ca(2+) and perivascular K(+).},

abstract = {Shear stress stimulates nitric oxide (NO) production by phosphorylating endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) at Ser(1179) in a phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)- and protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent manner. The eNOS has additional potential phosphorylation sites, including Ser(116), Thr(497), and Ser(635). Here, we studied these potential phosphorylation sites in response to shear, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and 8-bromocAMP (8-BRcAMP) in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). All three stimuli induced phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser(635), which was consistently slower than that at Ser(1179). Thr(497) was rapidly dephosphorylated by 8-BRcAMP but not by shear and VEGF. None of the stimuli phosphorylated Ser(116). Whereas shear-stimulated Ser(635) phosphorylation was not affected by phosphoinositide-3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY-294002, it was blocked by either treating the cells with a PKA inhibitor H89 or infecting them with a recombinant adenovirus-expressing PKA inhibitor. These results suggest that shear stress stimulates eNOS by two different mechanisms: 1) PKA- and PI3K-dependent and 2) PKA-dependent but PI3K-independent pathways. Phosphorylation of Ser(635) may play an important role in chronic regulation of eNOS in response to mechanical and humoral stimuli.},

@article{Corson1996a,
abstract = {Endothelial cells release nitric oxide (NO) more potently in response to increased shear stress than to agonists which elevate intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). To determine mechanistic differences in the regulation of endothelial constitutive NO synthase (ecNOS), we measured NO production by bovine aortic endothelial cells exposed to shear stress in a laminar flow chamber or treated with Ca2+ ionophores in static culture. The kinetics of cumulative NO production varied strikingly: shear stress (25 dyne/cm2) stimulated a biphasic increase over control that was 13-fold at 60 minutes, whereas raising [Ca2+]i caused a monophasic 6-fold increase. We hypothesized that activation of a protein kinase cascade mediates the early phase of flow-dependent NO production. Immunoprecipitation of ecNOS showed a 210\% increase in phosphorylation 1 minute after flow initiation, whereas there was no significant increase after Ca2+ ionophore treatment. Although ecNOS was not tyrosine-phosphorylated, the early phase of flow-dependent NO production was blocked by genistein, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases. To determine the Ca2+ requirement for flow-dependent NO production, we measured [Ca2+]i with a novel flow-step protocol. [Ca2+]i increased with the onset of shear stress, but not after a step increase. However, the step increase in shear stress was associated with a potent biphasic increase in NO production rate and ecNOS phosphorylation. These studies demonstrate that shear stress can increase NO production in the absence of increased [Ca2+]i, and they suggest that phosphorylation of ecNOS may importantly modulate its activity during the imposition of increased shear stress.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: NO-induced dilations in resistance arteries (RAs) are not associated with decreases in vascular smooth muscle cell Ca2+. We tested whether a cGMP-dependent activation of the smooth muscle myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) resulting in a Ca2+ desensitization of the contractile apparatus was the underlying mechanism and whether it could be antagonized by the RhoA pathway.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The Ca2+ sensitivity of RA was assessed as the relation between changes in diameter and [Ca2+]i in depolarized RA (120 mol/L K+) exposed to stepwise increases in Ca2+ex (0 to 3 mmol/L). Effects of 10 micromol/L sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on Ca2+ sensitivity were determined before and after application of the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ (1 micromol/L) and the MLCP inhibitor calyculin A (120 nmol/L) and in presence of the RhoA-activating phospholipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P, 12 nmol/L). SNP-induced dilations were also studied in controls and in RAs pretreated with the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 or transfected with a dominant-negative RhoA mutant (N19RhoA). Constrictions elicited by increasing Ca2+ex were significantly attenuated by SNP, which, however, left associated increases in [Ca2+]i unaffected. This NO-induced attenuation was blocked by ODQ, calyculin A, and S1P. The S1P-induced translocation of RhoA indicating activation of the GTPase was not reversed by SNP. Inhibition of RhoA/Rho kinase by N19RhoA or Y27632 significantly augmented SNP-induced dilations.

CONCLUSIONS: NO dilates RA by activating the MLCP in a cGMP-dependent manner, thereby reducing the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus. MLCP inactivation via the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway antagonizes this Ca2+-desensitizing effect that, in turn, can be restored using RhoA/Rho kinase inhibitors.},

abstract = {Vascular cells communicate electrically to coordinate their activity and control tissue blood flow. To foster a quantitative understanding of this fundamental process, we developed a computational model that was structured to mimic a skeletal muscle resistance artery. Each endothelial cell and smooth muscle cell in our virtual artery was treated as the electrical equivalent of a capacitor coupled in parallel with a non-linear resistor representing ionic conductance; intercellular gap junctions were represented by ohmic resistors. Simulations revealed that the vessel wall is not a syncytium in which electrical stimuli spread equally to all constitutive cells. Indeed, electrical signals spread in a differential manner among and between endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells according to the initial stimulus. The predictions of our model agree with physiological data from the feed artery of the hamster retractor muscle. Cell orientation and coupling resistance were the principal factors that enable electrical signals to spread differentially along and between the two cell types. Our computational observations also illustrated how gap junctional coupling enables the vessel wall to filter and transform transient electrical events into sustained voltage responses. Functionally, differential electrical communication would permit discrete regions of smooth muscle activity to locally regulate blood flow and the endothelium to coordinate regional changes in tissue perfusion.},

abstract = {Amyloid beta (A$\beta$) has been proposed to play a central and causative role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. A$\beta$(25-35), the neurotoxic domain of the full-length A$\beta$, causes learning and memory impairments in rodents. The present study investigated the effects of a single bilateral i.c.v. infusion of pre-aggregated A$\beta$(25-35) (30 nmol/rat) on animals' performance in the open field, and on arginine metabolic enzymes and metabolites in the CA1, CA2/3, and dentate gyrus (DG) sub-regions of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) at the time point of 6-8 days after A$\beta$ infusion. A$\beta$(25-35) rats displayed reduced exploratory activity in the open field relative to the A$\beta$(35-25) (reverse peptide; 30 nmol) rats. A$\beta$(25-35) resulted in significantly decreased nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and endothelial NOS protein expression, but increased arginase activity, arginase II protein expression, and ornithine and putrescine levels, in hippocampal CA2/3. There were increased glutamate and putrescine levels in the DG, but decreased agmatine levels in the DG and PFC, in the A$\beta$(25-35) group relative to the A$\beta$(35-25) one. Cluster analyses were performed to determine if the nine related neurochemical variables (arginine, citrulline, ornithine, agmatine, putrescine, spermidine, spemine, glutamate, and GABA) formed distinct groups, and whether it changed as a function of A$\beta$(25-35). There were substantially different clusters between the two groups in the hippocampus and PFC. These results demonstrate that A$\beta$(25-35) alters arginine metabolism, which further supports the prominent role of arginine and its metabolites in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis.},

abstract = {It is well-known that cyclic variations of the vascular diameter, a phenomenon called vasomotion, are induced by synchronous calcium oscillations of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). However, the role of the endothelium on vasomotion is unclear. Some experimental studies claim that the endothelium is necessary for synchronization and vasomotion, whereas others report rhythmic contractions in the absence of an intact endothelium. Moreover, endothelium-derived factors have been shown to abolish vasomotion by desynchronizing the calcium signals in SMCs. By modeling the calcium dynamics of a population of SMCs coupled to a population of endothelial cells, we analyze the effects of an SMC vasoconstrictor stimulation on endothelial cells and the feedback of endothelium-derived factors. Our results show that the endothelium essentially decreases the SMCs calcium level and may move the SMCs from a steady state to an oscillatory domain, and vice versa. In the oscillatory domain, a population of coupled SMCs exhibits synchronous calcium oscillations. Outside the oscillatory domain, the coupled SMCs present only irregular calcium flashings arising from noise modeling stochastic opening of channels. Our findings provide explanations for the published contradictory experimental observations.},

abstract = {The brain is critically dependent on a continuous supply of blood to function. Therefore, the cerebral vasculature is endowed with neurovascular control mechanisms that assure that the blood supply of the brain is commensurate to the energy needs of its cellular constituents. The regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) during brain activity involves the coordinated interaction of neurons, glia, and vascular cells. Thus, whereas neurons and glia generate the signals initiating the vasodilation, endothelial cells, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells act in concert to transduce these signals into carefully orchestrated vascular changes that lead to CBF increases focused to the activated area and temporally linked to the period of activation. Neurovascular coupling is disrupted in pathological conditions, such as hypertension, Alzheimer disease, and ischemic stroke. Consequently, CBF is no longer matched to the metabolic requirements of the tissue. This cerebrovascular dysregulation is mediated in large part by the deleterious action of reactive oxygen species on cerebral blood vessels. A major source of cerebral vascular radicals in models of hypertension and Alzheimer disease is the enzyme NADPH oxidase. These findings, collectively, highlight the importance of neurovascular coupling to the health of the normal brain and suggest a therapeutic target for improving brain function in pathologies associated with cerebrovascular dysfunction.},

abstract = {A cell culture model of blood-brain barrier (BBB, coculture of rat brain endothelial cells with rat astrocytes) was used to investigate the effect of nitric oxide (.NO) on the damage of the BBB induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). Permeability coefficient of fluorescein across the endothelium was used as a marker of BBB tightness. The permeability coefficient increased 5.2 times after H/R indicating strong disruption of the BBB. The presence of the .NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP, 30 microM), authentic .NO (6 microM) or superoxide dismutase (50 units/ml) during H/R attenuated H/R-induced increase in permeability. 30 microM SNAP or 6 microM .NO did not influence the function of BBB during normoxia, however, severe disruption was observed using 150 microM of SNAP and more than 24 microM of .NO. After H/R of endothelial cells, the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) increased 2.3 times indicating radical-induced peroxidation of membrane lipids. 30 microM SNAP or 6 microM authentic .NO completely prevented MDA formation. The results show that .NO may effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species formed during H/R of brain capillary endothelial cells, affording protection of BBB at the molecular and functional level.},

abstract = {Astrocytes comprise approximately half of the volume of the adult mammalian brain and are the primary neuronal structural and trophic supportive elements. Astrocytes are organized into distinct nonoverlapping domains and extend elaborate and dense fine processes that interact intimately with synapses and cerebrovasculature. The recognition in the mid 1990s that astrocytes undergo elevations in intracellular calcium concentration following activation of G protein-coupled receptors by synaptically released neurotransmitters demonstrated not only that astrocytes display a form of excitability but also that astrocytes may be active participants in brain information processing. The roles that astrocytic calcium elevations play in neurophysiology and especially in modulation of neuronal activity have been intensely researched in recent years. This review will summarize the current understanding of the function of astrocytic calcium signaling in neurophysiological processes and discuss areas where the role of astrocytes remains controversial and will therefore benefit from further study.},

abstract = {In vivo studies on frog mesenteric arterioles (4) indicate that segmental differences in the response of microvessels to physical and chemical stimuli can be explained simply in terms of the length-tension characteristics of vascular smooth muscle at different points along the vascular tree. Studies on single, isolated arterioles in vitro were initiated to examine more closely the validity of this explanation for regional response differences. This paper reports some of the results. First-, second-, and third-order arterioles (18-60 micron i.d.) were dissected from hamster cheek pouches. The vessels were cannulated with a modified Burg microperfusion system, and their mechanical properties studied using the methods described by Duling and Gore. Vessels were activated in four stages with K+ and norepinephrine. During activation, transmural pressures were adjusted to minimize vascular smooth-muscle shortening. Active pressure-diameter curves were recorded while adjusting transmural pressure through the range 5 to 400 cm H20 in 5-25 cm steps. Vessel dimensions were measured with a videomicrometer. Passive curves were obtained after equilibration overnight in Ca2+-free medium. The vessels were then fixed and prepared for histologic sectioning, and measurements of vessel-wall composition were made. The Laplace relationship was used to construct length-tension diagrams, and the histologic data were used to normalize the dimensional data to smooth-muscle lengths. Maximum active tension of second-order arterioles (1,170 dynes/cm) was two times previous values reported by Gore et al. This was due presumably to refinements in techniques and dissection procedures. Maximum active stress averaged 3.9 X 10(+6) dynes/cm2 for second-order arterioles. This number is identical to data obtained from hog carotid strips by Dillon et al.},

abstract = {Vascular cells communicate electrically to coordinate their activity and control tissue blood flow. To foster a quantitative understanding of this fundamental process, we developed a computational model that was structured to mimic a skeletal muscle resistance artery. Each endothelial cell and smooth muscle cell in our virtual artery was treated as the electrical equivalent of a capacitor coupled in parallel with a non-linear resistor representing ionic conductance; intercellular gap junctions were represented by ohmic resistors. Simulations revealed that the vessel wall is not a syncytium in which electrical stimuli spread equally to all constitutive cells. Indeed, electrical signals spread in a differential manner among and between endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells according to the initial stimulus. The predictions of our model agree with physiological data from the feed artery of the hamster retractor muscle. Cell orientation and coupling resistance were the principal factors that enable electrical signals to spread differentially along and between the two cell types. Our computational observations also illustrated how gap junctional coupling enables the vessel wall to filter and transform transient electrical events into sustained voltage responses. Functionally, differential electrical communication would permit discrete regions of smooth muscle activity to locally regulate blood flow and the endothelium to coordinate regional changes in tissue perfusion.},

abstract = {Increasing evidence supports a crucial role for glial metabolism in maintaining proper synaptic function and in the etiology of neurological disease. However, the study of glial metabolism in humans has been hampered by the lack of noninvasive methods. To specifically measure the contribution of astroglia to brain energy metabolism in humans, we used a novel noninvasive nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic approach. We measured carbon 13 incorporation into brain glutamate and glutamine in eight volunteers during an intravenous infusion of [2-13C] acetate, which has been shown in animal models to be metabolized specifically in astroglia. Mathematical modeling of the three established pathways for neurotransmitter glutamate repletion indicates that the glutamate/glutamine neurotransmitter cycle between astroglia and neurons (0.32 +/- 0.07 micromol x gm(-1) x min(-1)) is the major pathway for neuronal glutamate repletion and that the astroglial TCA cycle flux (0.14 +/- 0.06 micromol x gm(-1) x min(-1)) accounts for approximately 14\% of brain oxygen consumption. Up to 30\% of the glutamine transferred to the neurons by the cycle may derive from replacement of oxidized glutamate by anaplerosis. The further application of this approach could potentially enlighten the role of astroglia in supporting brain glutamatergic activity and in neurological and psychiatric disease.},

abstract = {Fast excitatory synapses are generally thought to act as private communication channels between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. Some recent findings, however, suggest that glutamate may diffuse out of the synaptic cleft and bind to several subtypes of receptors, either in the perisynaptic membrane or at neighboring synapses. it is not known whether activation of these receptors can occur in response to the release of a single vesicle of glutamate. Here we estimate the spatiotemporal profile of glutamate in the extrasynaptic space after vesicle exocytosis, guided by detailed ultrastructural measurements of the CA1 neuropil in the adult rat. We argue that the vicinity of the synapse can be treated as an isotropic porous medium, in which diffusion is determined by the extracellular volume fraction and the tortuosity factor, and develop novel stereological methods to estimate these parameters. We also estimate the spatial separation between synapses, to ask whether glutamate released at one synapse can activate NMDA and other high-affinity receptors at a neighboring synapse. Kinetic simulations of extrasynaptic glutamate uptake show that transporters rapidly reduce the free concentration of transmitter. Exocytosis of a single vesicle is, however, sufficient to bind to high-affinity receptors situated in the immediate perisynaptic space. The distance separating a typical synapse from its nearest neighbor is similar to 465 nm. Whether glutamate can reach a sufficient concentration to activate NMDA receptors at this distance depends critically on the diffusion coefficient in the extracellular space. If diffusion is much slower than in free aqueous solution, NMDA receptors could mediate crosstalk between neighboring synapses.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in autocrine and paracrine manner in numerous physiological processes, including regulation of blood pressure and blood flow, platelet aggregation, and leukocyte adhesion. In vascular wall, most of the bioavailable NO is believed to derive from endothelial cell NO synthase (eNOS). Recently, neuronal NOS (nNOS) has been identified as a source of NO in the vicinity of microvessels and has been shown to participate in vascular function. Thus NO can be produced and transported to the vascular smooth muscle cells from 1). endothelial cells and 2). perivascular nerve fibers, mast cells, and other nNOS-containing sources. In this study, a mathematical model of NO diffusion-reaction in a cylindrical arteriolar segment was formulated. The model quantifies the relative contribution of these NO sources and the smooth muscle availability of NO in a tissue containing an arteriolar blood vessel. The results indicate that a source of NO derived through nNOS in the perivascular region can be a significant contributor to smooth muscle NO. Predicted smooth muscle NO concentrations are as high as 430 nM, which is consistent with reported experimental measurements approximately 400 nM). In addition, we used the model to analyze the smooth muscle NO availability in 1). eNOS and nNOS knockout experiments, 2). the presence of myoglobin, and 3). the presence of cell-free Hb, e.g., Hb-based oxygen carriers. The results show that NO release by nNOS would significantly affect available smooth muscle NO. Further experimental and theoretical studies are required to account for distribution of NOS isoforms and determine NO availability in vasculatures of different tissues.},

abstract = {Thrombin has been found in neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Also, traumatic brain injury, where neurons are exposed to high thrombin levels, is associated with an increased incidence of AD. Our objective was to determine the effects of thrombin administered in vivo on cognitive function and neuropathology. Rats were trained using a radial eight-arm maze and then thrombin (25 or 100 nM, 0.25 microl/h, 28 days) or vehicle was delivered via intracerebroventricular infusion. Animals that received 100 nM thrombin demonstrated cognitive impairments including deficits in reference memory and an increase in task latency. Also, significant neuropathology was detected in these animals such as enlargement of cerebral ventricles, an increased number of TUNEL-positive cells, astrogliosis, and an increase in the immunoreactivity for phosphorylated neurofilament, and apolipoprotein-E fragments. Thrombin-induced changes in cognitive function and ventricular enlargement were inhibited by hirudin. These findings demonstrate that thrombin is a mediator of neurotoxicity and cognitive deficits and suggest that inhibition of thrombin may be a treatment strategy for AD- or head trauma-associated cognitive deficits.},

@article{Andrews2010,
abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) produced by the endothelium is involved in the regulation of vascular tone. Decreased NO production or availability has been linked to endothelial dysfunction in hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. Shear stress-induced NO release is a well-established phenomenon, yet the cellular mechanisms of this response are not completely understood. Experimental limitations have hindered direct, real-time measurements of NO under flow conditions. We have overcome these challenges with a new design for a parallel-plate flow chamber. The chamber consists of two compartments, separated by a Transwell® membrane, which isolates a NO recording electrode located in the upper compartment from flow effects. Endothelial cells are grown on the bottom of the membrane, which is inserted into the chamber flush with the upper plate. We demonstrate for the first time direct real-time NO measurements from endothelial cells with controlled variations in shear stress. Step changes in shear stress from 0.1dyn/cm2 to 6, 10, or 20dyn/cm2 elicited a transient decrease in NO followed by an increase to a new steady state. An analysis of NO transport suggests that the initial decrease is due to the increased removal rate by convection as flow increases. Furthermore, the rate at which the NO concentration approaches the new steady state is related to the time-dependent cellular response rather than transport limitations of the measurement configuration. Our design offers a method for studying the kinetics of the signaling mechanisms linking NO production with shear stress as well as pathological conditions involving changes in NO production or availability. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Modern neuroimaging techniques rely on neurovascular coupling to show regions of increased brain activation. However, little is known of the neurovascular coupling relationships that exist for inhibitory signals. To address this issue directly we developed a preparation to investigate the signal sources of one of these proposed inhibitory neurovascular signals, the negative blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response (NBR), in rat somatosensory cortex. We found a reliable NBR measured in rat somatosensory cortex in response to unilateral electrical whisker stimulation, which was located in deeper cortical layers relative to the positive BOLD response. Separate optical measurements (two-dimensional optical imaging spectroscopy and laser Doppler flowmetry) revealed that the NBR was a result of decreased blood volume and flow and increased levels of deoxyhemoglobin. Neural activity in the NBR region, measured by multichannel electrodes, varied considerably as a function of cortical depth. There was a decrease in neuronal activity in deep cortical laminae. After cessation of whisker stimulation there was a large increase in neural activity above baseline. Both the decrease in neuronal activity and increase above baseline after stimulation cessation correlated well with the simultaneous measurement of blood flow suggesting that the NBR is related to decreases in neural activity in deep cortical layers. Interestingly, the magnitude of the neural decrease was largest in regions showing stimulus-evoked positive BOLD responses. Since a similar type of neural suppression in surround regions was associated with a negative BOLD signal, the increased levels of suppression in positive BOLD regions could importantly moderate the size of the observed BOLD response.},

abstract = {The brain is critically dependent on a continuous supply of blood to function. Therefore, the cerebral vasculature is endowed with neurovascular control mechanisms that assure that the blood supply of the brain is commensurate to the energy needs of its cellular constituents. The regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) during brain activity involves the coordinated interaction of neurons, glia, and vascular cells. Thus, whereas neurons and glia generate the signals initiating the vasodilation, endothelial cells, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells act in concert to transduce these signals into carefully orchestrated vascular changes that lead to CBF increases focused to the activated area and temporally linked to the period of activation. Neurovascular coupling is disrupted in pathological conditions, such as hypertension, Alzheimer disease, and ischemic stroke. Consequently, CBF is no longer matched to the metabolic requirements of the tissue. This cerebrovascular dysregulation is mediated in large part by the deleterious action of reactive oxygen species on cerebral blood vessels. A major source of cerebral vascular radicals in models of hypertension and Alzheimer disease is the enzyme NADPH oxidase. These findings, collectively, highlight the importance of neurovascular coupling to the health of the normal brain and suggest a therapeutic target for improving brain function in pathologies associated with cerebrovascular dysfunction.},

abstract = {The question of the preferred substrate of glutamatergic neurons at high neural activity has been vibrantly debated for over a decade since the classical hypothesis (CH) of the primacy of glucose has been challenged by the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis (ANLSH), which replaces the primacy of glucose with astrocyte produced lactate. We perform Bayesian Flux Balance Analysis (BFBA) with a new mathematical model of cellular brain energetics, comprising detailed biochemical pathways in and between astrocytes and glutamatergic neurons and partitioning of each cell type into cytosol and mitochondria. Supported by the results of our in silico studies, which are in remarkable agreement with previously published results, we posit the Glucose Shunt Hypothesis (GSH) that during high activity, the inhibition of the phosphofructokinase (PFK) enzyme in neuron impairs neuronal glycolysis, enabling the process by which lactate effluxed by astrocytes is taken up by glutamatergic neurons, whereas at low activity, glucose remains the preferred substrate for neurons. We postulate that the ANLS is a shunt utilized by glutamatergic neurons to bypass their glycolysis impaired by the inhibition of PFK in connection with increased oxidative phosphorylation at high neuronal activity.},

abstract = {During saccadic motion the eyewall moves in a manner similar to a sinusoid or at least can be represented by a sine Fourier series. Motion of the vitreous is induced by the saccade and the vitreo-retinal interface is subjected to a time-dependent shear. This force may be a significant factor for retinal tearing in the neighbourhood of small retinal holes or tears. An analytical viscoelastic model and a numerical, Newtonian model of the motion of the vitreous are presented and compared. Under sinusoidal boundary motion the analytical model shows that a viscous wave propagates inward toward the axis of rotation and the characteristic length of this wave is a function of the Womersley number. The numerical solution indicates that the vitreous moves similarly to the analytical result with small secondary motion; however, this motion allows complete recirculation of the vitreous over large timescales. Excellent agreement is found between the analytical and numerical models. The time-dependent fluid shear is evaluated and from the analytical solution the maximum value of this is found to be proportional to R0 square root of v(omega)3, where R0 is the eye radius, v the modified complex viscosity and omega the sinusoidal frequency. This indicates that myopes have a larger shear force exerted on them by virtue of the larger eye size. Further work is directed toward a model which links the stress found in the sclera to that exerted on the vitreo-retinal interface by the vitreous fluid motion.},

abstract = {Numerical simulations of unsteady blood flow through a honeycomb network originating at multiple inlets and terminating at multiple outlets are presented and discussed under the assumption that blood behaves as a continuum with variable constitution. Unlike a tree network, the honeycomb network exhibits both diverging and converging bifurcations between branching capillary segments. Numerical results based on a finite difference method demonstrate that as in the case of tree networks considered in previous studies, the cell partitioning law at diverging bifurcations is an important parameter in both steady and unsteady flow. Specifically, a steady flow may spontaneously develop self-sustained oscillations at critical conditions by way of a Hopf bifurcation. Contrary to tree-like networks comprised entirely of diverging bifurcations, the critical parameters for instability in honeycomb networks depend weakly on the system size. The blockage of one or more network segments due to the presence of large cells or the occurrence of capillary constriction may cause flow reversal or trigger a transition to unsteady flow.},

abstract = {Peptides derived from proteolytic processing of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), including the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), play a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's dementia. We report that transgenic mice overexpressing APP and Abeta have a profound attenuation in the increase in neocortical blood flow elicited by somatosensory activation. The impairment is highly correlated with brain Abeta concentration and is reproduced in normal mice by topical neocortical application of exogenous Abeta1-40 but not Abeta1-42. Overexpression of M146L mutant presenilin-1 in APP mice enhances the production of Abeta1-42 severalfold, but it does not produce a commensurate attenuation of the hyperemic response. APP and Abeta overexpression do not diminish the intensity of neural activation, as reflected by the increase in somatosensory cortex glucose usage. Thus, Abeta-induced alterations in functional hyperemia produce a potentially deleterious mismatch between substrate delivery and energy demands imposed by neural activity.},

abstract = {The cloned BK channel alpha subunit from human myometrium was stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, either alone (CHOalpha cells) or in combination with the auxiliary beta subunit (CHOalpha+beta cells). We studied basic channel properties and the effects of cGMP- and cAMP-dependent protein kinases on the BK channel activity. Coexpression of alpha and beta subunits enhanced the Ca2+ and voltage sensitivity of the BK channel, and decreased the inhibitory potency of iberiotoxin. Blocking and stimulating effects on BK channel activity by charybdotoxin and nitric oxide, respectively, were independent of the beta subunit. The cGMP kinase Ialpha and cAMP kinase failed to affect BK channel activity in CHOalpha and CHOalpha+beta cells at different [Ca2+]i and voltages. In contrast, BK channels in freshly isolated myometrial cells from postmenopausal women responded to cAMP kinase and cGMP kinase with a fourfold and twofold decrease in their open probability (NPo), respectively. These effects could be reversed by alkaline phosphatase and remained unaffected by the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (100 nM). In 28\% of myometrial cells, however, cAMP and cGMP kinases increased NPo 2-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively. This stimulation was enhanced rather than reversed by alkaline phosphatase and was abolished by 100 nM okadaic acid. The results suggest that in stably transfected CHO cells the expressed BK channel is not regulated by cAMP kinase and cGMP kinase. However, in native myometrial cells stimulatory and inhibitory regulation of BK channels by cAMP kinase and cGMP kinase was observed, suggesting that channel regulation by the protein kinases requires factors that are not provided by CHO cells. Alternatively, failure of regulation may have been due to the primary structure of the myometrial BK channel protein used in this study.},

abstract = {The unravelling of the polarized distribution of AQP4 in perivascular astrocytic endfeet has revitalized the interest in the role of astrocytes in controlling water and ion exchange at the brain-blood interface. The importance of the endfeet is based on the premise that they constitute a complete coverage of the vessel wall. Despite a number of studies based on different microscopic techniques this question has yet to be resolved. We have made an electron microscopic 3D reconstruction of perivascular endfeet in CA1 (stratum moleculare) of rat hippocampus. The endfeet interdigitate and overlap, leaving no slits between them. Only in a few sites do processes--tentatively classified as processes of microglia--extend through the perivascular glial sheath to establish direct contact with the endothelial basal lamina. In contrast to the endfoot covering of the endothelial tube, the endfoot covering of the pericyte is incomplete, allowing neuropil elements to touch the basal lamina that enwraps this type of cell. The 3D reconstruction also revealed large bundles of mitochondria in the endfoot processes that came in close apposition to the perivascular endfoot membrane. Our data support the idea that in pathophysiological conditions, the perivascular astrocytic covering may control the exchange of water and solutes between blood and brain and that free diffusion is limited to narrow clefts between overlapping endfeet.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO), the smallest signalling molecule known, is produced by three isoforms of NO synthase (NOS; EC 1.14.13.39). They all utilize l-arginine and molecular oxygen as substrates and require the cofactors reduced nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and (6R-)5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)). All NOS bind calmodulin and contain haem. Neuronal NOS (nNOS, NOS I) is constitutively expressed in central and peripheral neurons and some other cell types. Its functions include synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS), central regulation of blood pressure, smooth muscle relaxation, and vasodilatation via peripheral nitrergic nerves. Nitrergic nerves are of particular importance in the relaxation of corpus cavernosum and penile erection. Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil) require at least a residual nNOS activity for their action. Inducible NOS (NOS II) can be expressed in many cell types in response to lipopolysaccharide, cytokines, or other agents. Inducible NOS generates large amounts of NO that have cytostatic effects on parasitic target cells. Inducible NOS contributes to the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases and septic shock. Endothelial NOS (eNOS, NOS III) is mostly expressed in endothelial cells. It keeps blood vessels dilated, controls blood pressure, and has numerous other vasoprotective and anti-atherosclerotic effects. Many cardiovascular risk factors lead to oxidative stress, eNOS uncoupling, and endothelial dysfunction in the vasculature. Pharmacologically, vascular oxidative stress can be reduced and eNOS functionality restored with renin- and angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors, with angiotensin receptor blockers, and with statins.},

The physiology of the arterial microcirculation is then assessed. Lastly, we review the changes during ischemia which impact on the microcirculation. Further understanding of the normal cerebrovascular anatomy and physiology as well as the pathophysiology of ischemia will allow the rational development of a pharmacologic therapy for human stroke and brain injury.},

@article{Gore1984a,
abstract = {In vivo studies on frog mesenteric arterioles (4) indicate that segmental differences in the response of microvessels to physical and chemical stimuli can be explained simply in terms of the length-tension characteristics of vascular smooth muscle at different points along the vascular tree. Studies on single, isolated arterioles in vitro were initiated to examine more closely the validity of this explanation for regional response differences. This paper reports some of the results. First-, second-, and third-order arterioles (18-60 micron i.d.) were dissected from hamster cheek pouches. The vessels were cannulated with a modified Burg microperfusion system, and their mechanical properties studied using the methods described by Duling and Gore. Vessels were activated in four stages with K+ and norepinephrine. During activation, transmural pressures were adjusted to minimize vascular smooth-muscle shortening. Active pressure-diameter curves were recorded while adjusting transmural pressure through the range 5 to 400 cm H20 in 5-25 cm steps. Vessel dimensions were measured with a videomicrometer. Passive curves were obtained after equilibration overnight in Ca2+-free medium. The vessels were then fixed and prepared for histologic sectioning, and measurements of vessel-wall composition were made. The Laplace relationship was used to construct length-tension diagrams, and the histologic data were used to normalize the dimensional data to smooth-muscle lengths. Maximum active tension of second-order arterioles (1,170 dynes/cm) was two times previous values reported by Gore et al. This was due presumably to refinements in techniques and dissection procedures. Maximum active stress averaged 3.9 X 10(+6) dynes/cm2 for second-order arterioles. This number is identical to data obtained from hog carotid strips by Dillon et al.},

@article{Barreto2011,
abstract = {In the past two decades, over 1000 clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a benefit in treating stroke, with the exception of thrombolytics. Although many targets have been pursued, including antioxidants, calcium channel blockers, glutamate receptor blockers, and neurotrophic factors, often the focus has been on neuronal mechanisms of injury. Broader attention to loss and dysfunction of non-neuronal cell types is now required to increase the chance of success. Of the several glial cell types, this review will focus on astrocytes. Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the higher mammalian nervous system, and they play key roles in normal CNS physiology and in central nervous system injury and pathology. In the setting of ischemia astrocytes perform multiple functions, some beneficial and some potentially detrimental, making them excellent candidates as therapeutic targets to improve outcome following stroke and in other central nervous system injuries. The older neurocentric view of the central nervous system has changed radically with the growing understanding of the many essential functions of astrocytes. These include K+ buffering, glutamate clearance, brain antioxidant defense, close metabolic coupling with neurons, and modulation of neuronal excitability. In this review, we will focus on those functions of astrocytes that can both protect and endanger neurons, and discuss how manipulating these functions provides a novel and important strategy to enhance neuronal survival and improve outcome following cerebral ischemia.},

If all the positive entries are log-convex functions, the paper shows that the associated Perron root is log-convex on the parameter set and the l1-norm of the solution is log-convex on the feasibility set. These results imply that the feasibility set is a convex set regardless whether the l1-norm of the solution is bounded by some positive real number or not. Finally, we show important applications of these results to wireless communication networks and prove some other interesting results for this special case.},

abstract = {Amyloid-$\beta$ interacts with two cell surface receptors, CD36 and CD47, through which the matricellular protein thrombospondin-1 inhibits soluble guanylate cyclase activation. Here we examine whether amyloid-$\beta$ shares this inhibitory activity. Amyloid-$\beta$ inhibited both drug and nitric oxide-mediated activation of soluble guanylate cyclase in several cell types. Known cGMP-dependent functional responses to nitric oxide in platelets and vascular smooth muscle cells were correspondingly inhibited by amyloid-$\beta$. Functional interaction of amyloid-$\beta$ with the scavenger receptor CD36 was indicated by inhibition of free fatty acid uptake via this receptor. Both soluble oligomer and fibrillar forms of amyloid-$\beta$ were active. In contrast, amyloid-$\beta$ did not compete with the known ligand SIRP$\alpha$ for binding to CD47. However, both receptors were necessary for amyloid-$\beta$ to inhibit cGMP accumulation. These data suggest that amyloid-$\beta$ interaction with CD36 induces a CD47-dependent signal that inhibits soluble guanylate cyclase activation. Combined with the pleiotropic effects of inhibiting free fatty acid transport via CD36, these data provides a molecular mechanism through which amyloid-$\beta$ can contribute to the nitric oxide signaling deficiencies associated with Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {The brain is critically dependent on a continuous supply of blood to function. Therefore, the cerebral vasculature is endowed with neurovascular control mechanisms that assure that the blood supply of the brain is commensurate to the energy needs of its cellular constituents. The regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) during brain activity involves the coordinated interaction of neurons, glia, and vascular cells. Thus, whereas neurons and glia generate the signals initiating the vasodilation, endothelial cells, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells act in concert to transduce these signals into carefully orchestrated vascular changes that lead to CBF increases focused to the activated area and temporally linked to the period of activation. Neurovascular coupling is disrupted in pathological conditions, such as hypertension, Alzheimer disease, and ischemic stroke. Consequently, CBF is no longer matched to the metabolic requirements of the tissue. This cerebrovascular dysregulation is mediated in large part by the deleterious action of reactive oxygen species on cerebral blood vessels. A major source of cerebral vascular radicals in models of hypertension and Alzheimer disease is the enzyme NADPH oxidase. These findings, collectively, highlight the importance of neurovascular coupling to the health of the normal brain and suggest a therapeutic target for improving brain function in pathologies associated with cerebrovascular dysfunction.},

WIT003, ABSA and 20-HETE all had a similar effect to reduce the diameter of the middle cerebral artery by 26\%. WIT003 and 20-HETE both increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from the middle cerebral artery. In contrast, WIT002 had no effect on the basal diameter of the middle cerebral artery but it attenuated the vasoconstrictor responses and the rise in [Ca2+]i in vascular smooth muscle cells following administration of 20-HETE and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). WIT003 partially restored the vasoconstrictor response to 5-HT in the middle cerebral artery after administration of an inhibitor of the endogenous synthesis of 20-HETE. Infusion of the 20-HETE agonists, WIT003 and ABSA, into cisterna magna of rats reduced baseline cerebral blood flow by 20\%, whereas administration of the 20-HETE antagonist, WIT002, had no effect. Intracisternal injection of WIT002 attenuated the fall in cerebral blood flow following injection of blood into the cisterna magna, whereas administration of the 20-HETE agonist, ABSA, potentiated this response. These findings indicate that the 20-HETE agonists, WIT003 and ABSA, increase cerebral vascular tone both in vivo and in vitro and suggest blocking the vasoconstrictor actions of 20-HETE may be useful to prevent the acute fall in cerebral blood flow following subarachnoid hemorrhage.},

abstract = {Neural signalling within the central nervous system (CNS) requires a highly controlled microenvironment. Cells at three key interfaces form barriers between the blood and the CNS: the blood-brain barrier (BBB), blood-CSF barrier and the arachnoid barrier. The BBB at the level of brain microvessel endothelium is the major site of blood-CNS exchange. The structure and function of the BBB is summarised, the physical barrier formed by the endothelial tight junctions, and the transport barrier resulting from membrane transporters and vesicular mechanisms. The roles of associated cells are outlined, especially the endfeet of astrocytic glial cells, and pericytes and microglia. The embryonic development of the BBB, and changes in pathology are described. The BBB is subject to short and long-term regulation, which may be disturbed in pathology. Any programme for drug discovery or delivery, to target or avoid the CNS, needs to consider the special features of the BBB.},

abstract = {Neural activity is intimately tied to blood flow in the brain. This coupling is specific enough in space and time that modern imaging methods use local hemodynamics as a measure of brain activity. In this review, we discuss recent evidence indicating that neuronal activity is coupled to local blood flow changes through an intermediary, the astrocyte. We highlight unresolved issues regarding the role of astrocytes and propose ways to address them using novel techniques. Our focus is on cellular level analysis in vivo, but we also relate mechanistic insights gained from ex vivo experiments to native tissue. We also review some strategies to harness advances in optical and genetic methods to study neurovascular coupling in the intact brain.},

abstract = {Vascular endothelium expressing endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) produces nitric oxide (NO), which has a number of important physiological functions in the microvasculature. The rate of NO production by the endothelium is a critical determinant of NO distribution in the vascular wall. We have analyzed the biochemical pathways of NO synthesis and formulated a model to estimate NO production by the microvascular endothelium under physiological conditions. The model quantifies the NO produced by eNOS based on the kinetics of NO synthesis and the availability of eNOS and its intracellular substrates. The predicted NO production from microvessels was in the range of 0.005-0.1 microM/s. This range of predicted values is in agreement with some experimental values but is much lower than other rates previously measured or estimated from experimental data with the help of mathematical modeling. Paradoxical discrepancies between the model predictions and previously reported results based on experimental measurements of NO concentration in the vicinity of the arteriolar wall suggest that NO can also be released through eNOS-independent mechanisms, such as catalysis by neuronal NOS (nNOS). We also used our model to test the sensitivity of NO production to substrate availability, eNOS concentration, and potential rate-limiting factors. The results indicated that the predicted low level of NO production can be attributed primarily to a low expression of eNOS in the microvascular endothelial cells.},

In animals, nitric oxide is synthesized enzymatically from L-arginine through the actions of the nitric oxide synthases (NOSs). The three known NOS isoforms are all dimeric, bi-domain enzymes that contain iron protoporphyrin IX, flavin adenine dinucleotide, flavin mononucleotide, and tetrahydrobiopterin as bound prosthetic groups. This chapter summarizes information regarding the structure-function aspects of the NOSs, which includes composition of the domains, the protein residues and regions involved in prosthetic group binding, catalytic properties of the domains, the relationship between dimeric structure and prosthetic group binding and function, and factors that control assembly of NOS in cells.

abstract = {Neuronal activity in the brain is thought to be coupled to cerebral arterioles (functional hyperemia) through Ca2+ signals in astrocytes. Although functional hyperemia occurs rapidly, within seconds, such rapid signaling has not been demonstrated in situ, and Ca2+ measurements in parenchymal arterioles are still lacking. Using a laser scanning confocal microscope and fluorescence Ca2+ indicators, we provide the first evidence that in a brain slice preparation, increased neuronal activity by electrical stimulation (ES) is rapidly signaled, within seconds, to cerebral arterioles and is associated with astrocytic Ca2+ waves. Smooth muscle cells in parenchymal arterioles exhibited Ca2+ and diameter oscillations ("vasomotion") that were rapidly suppressed by ES. The neuronal-mediated Ca2+ rise in cortical astrocytes was dependent on intracellular (inositol trisphosphate [IP3]) and extracellular voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel sources. The Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin prevented the rise in astrocytic [Ca2+]i and the suppression of Ca2+ oscillations in parenchymal arterioles to ES, indicating that neuronal activity was necessary for both events. Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors in astrocytes significantly decreased the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations in parenchymal arterioles. This study supports the concept that astrocytic Ca2+ changes signal the cerebral microvasculature and indicate the novel concept that this communication occurs through the suppression of arteriolar [Ca2+]i oscillations and corresponding vasomotion.

abstract = {Smooth muscle cell (SMC) contraction is controlled by the Ca2+ and
Rho kinase signalling pathways. While the SMC Rho kinase system seems
to be reasonably constant, there is enormous variation with regard
to the mechanisms responsible for generating Ca2+ signals. One way
of dealing with this diversity is to consider how this system has
been adapted to control different SMC functions. Phasic SMCs (vas
deferens, uterus and bladder) rely on membrane depolarization to
drive Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. This depolarization
can be induced by neurotransmitters or through the operation of a
membrane oscillator. Many tonic SMCs (vascular, airway and corpus
cavernosum) are driven by a cytosolic Ca2+ oscillator that generates
periodic pulses of Ca2+. A similar oscillator is present in pacemaker
cells such as the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) and atypical
SMCs that control other tonic SMCs (gastrointestinal, urethra, ureter).
The changes in membrane potential induced by these cytosolic oscillators
does not drive contraction directly but it functions to couple together
individual oscillators to provide the synchronization that is a characteristic
feature of many tonic SMCs.},

In this study, we aimed to determine whether impairment of dCA is associated with atrophy in specific regions or globally, thereby affecting daily functions in stroke patients.We performed a retrospective analysis of 33 subjects with chronic infarctions in the middle cerebral artery territory, and 109 age-matched non-stroke subjects. dCA was assessed via the phase relationship between arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity. Brain tissue volumes were quantified from MRI. Functional status was assessed by gait speed, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), modified Rankin Scale, and NIH Stroke Score.Compared to the non-stroke group, stroke subjects showed degraded dCA bilaterally, and showed gray matter atrophy in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes ipsilateral to infarct. In stroke subjects, better dCA was associated with less temporal lobe gray matter atrophy on the infracted side ([Formula: see text] = 0.029), faster gait speed ([Formula: see text] = 0.018) and lower IADL score ([Formula: see text]0.002). Our results indicate that better dynamic cerebral perfusion regulation is associated with less atrophy and better long-term functional status in older adults with chronic ischemic infarctions.},

abstract = {We investigated the role of nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP in the coupling of neuronal activation to regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized rats. Whisker deflection (60 s) increased rCBF by 18 +/- 3\%. NO synthase (NOS) inhibition by N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA; topically) reduced the rCBF response to 9 +/- 4\% and resting rCBF to 80 +/- 8\%. NO donors [S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP; 50 microM), 3-morpholinosydnonimine (10 microM)] or 8-bromoguanosine 3', 5'-cyclic-monophosphate (8-BrcGMP; 100 microM)] restored resting rCBF and L-NNA-induced attenuation of the whisker response in the presence of L-NNA, whereas the NO-independent vasodilator papaverine (1 mM) had no effect on the whisker response. Basal cGMP levels were decreased to 35\% by L-NNA and restored to 65\% of control by subsequent SNAP superfusion. Inhibition of neuronal NOS by 7-nitroindazole (7-NI; 40 mg/kg ip) or soluble guanylyl cyclase by 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ; 100 microM) significantly reduced resting rCBF to 86 +/- 8 and 92 +/- 10\% and whisker rCBF response to 7 +/- 4 and 12 +/- 3\%, respectively. ODQ reduced tissue cGMP to 54\%. 8-BrcGMP restored the whisker response in the presence of 7-NI or ODQ. We conclude that NO, produced by neuronal NOS, is a modulator in the coupling of neuronal activation and rCBF in rat somatosensory cortex and that this effect is mainly mediated by cGMP. L-NNA-induced vasomotion was significantly reduced during increased neuronal activity and after restoration of basal NO levels, but not after restoration of cGMP.},

abstract = {Many experimental studies have shown that arterial smooth muscle cells respond with cytosolic calcium rises to vasoconstrictor stimulation. A low vasoconstrictor concentration gives rise to asynchronous spikes in the calcium concentration in a few cells (asynchronous flashing). With a greater vasoconstrictor concentration, the number of smooth muscle cells responding in this way increases (recruitment) and calcium oscillations may appear. These oscillations may eventually synchronize and generate arterial contraction and vasomotion. We show that these phenomena of recruitment and synchronization naturally emerge from a model of a population of smooth muscle cells coupled through their gap junctions. The effects of electrical, calcium, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate coupling are studied. A weak calcium coupling is crucial to obtain a synchronization of calcium oscillations and the minimal required calcium permeability is deduced. Moreover, we note that an electrical coupling can generate oscillations, but also has a desynchronizing effect. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate diffusion does not play an important role to achieve synchronization. Our model is validated by published in vitro experiments obtained on rat mesenteric arterial segments.},

NO plays an important role in the protection against the onset and progression of cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease is associated with a number of different disorders including hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension and diabetes. The underlying pathology for most cardiovascular diseases is atherosclerosis, which is in turn associated with endothelial dysfunctional. The cardioprotective roles of NO include regulation of blood pressure and vascular tone, inhibition of platelet aggregation and leukocyte adhesion, and prevention smooth muscle cell proliferation. Reduced bioavailability of NO is thought to be one of the central factors common to cardiovascular disease, although it is unclear whether this is a cause of, or result of, endothelial dysfunction. Disturbances in NO bioavailability leads to a loss of the cardio protective actions and in some case may even increase disease progression. In this chapter the cellular and biochemical mechanisms leading to reduced NO bioavailability are discussed and evidence for the prevalence of these mechanisms in cardiovascular disease evaluated.},

abstract = {Stroke and circulatory arrest cause interferences in blood flow to the brain that result in considerable tissue damage. The primary method to reduce or prevent neurologic damage to patients suffering from brain ischemia is prompt restoration of blood flow to the ischemic tissue. However, paradoxically, restoration of blood flow causes additional damage and exacerbates neurocognitive deficits among patients who suffer a brain ischemic event. Mitochondria play a critical role in reperfusion injury by producing excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) thereby damaging cellular components, and initiating cell death. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the mechanisms of mitochondrial ROS generation during reperfusion, and specifically, the role the mitochondrial membrane potential plays in the pathology of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. Additionally, we propose a temporal model of ROS generation in which posttranslational modifications of key oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) proteins caused by ischemia induce a hyperactive state upon reintroduction of oxygen. Hyperactive OxPhos generates high mitochondrial membrane potentials, a condition known to generate excessive ROS. Such a state would lead to a "burst" of ROS upon reperfusion, thereby causing structural and functional damage to the mitochondria and inducing cell death signaling that eventually culminate in tissue damage. Finally, we propose that strategies aimed at modulating this maladaptive hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential may be a novel therapeutic intervention and present specific studies demonstrating the cytoprotective effect of this treatment modality.},

Historically, astrocytes have been studied as a homogeneous group of cells. However, evidence has accumulated that suggests heterogeneity of astrocytes across brain regions as well as within the same brain regions. Astrocytes differ in their morphology, developmental origin, gene expression profile, physiological properties, function, and response to injury and disease. A better understanding of the heterogeneity of astrocytes will greatly aid investigation of the function of astrocytes in normal brain as well as the roles of astrocytes in neurological disorders.},

abstract = {Diffusion in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain is constrained by the volume fraction and the tortuosity and a modified diffusion equation represents the transport behavior of many molecules in the brain. Deviations from the equation reveal loss of molecules across the blood-brain barrier, through cellular uptake, binding, or other mechanisms. Early diffusion measurements used radiolabeled sucrose and other tracers. Presently, the real-time iontophoresis (RTI) method is employed for small ions and the integrative optical imaging (IOI) method for fluorescent macromolecules, including dextrans or proteins. Theoretical models and simulations of the ECS have explored the influence of ECS geometry, effects of dead-space microdomains, extracellular matrix, and interaction of macromolecules with ECS channels. Extensive experimental studies with the RTI method employing the cation tetramethylammonium (TMA) in normal brain tissue show that the volume fraction of the ECS typically is approximately 20\% and the tortuosity is approximately 1.6 (i.e., free diffusion coefficient of TMA is reduced by 2.6), although there are regional variations. These parameters change during development and aging. Diffusion properties have been characterized in several interventions, including brain stimulation, osmotic challenge, and knockout of extracellular matrix components. Measurements have also been made during ischemia, in models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and in human gliomas. Overall, these studies improve our conception of ECS structure and the roles of glia and extracellular matrix in modulating the ECS microenvironment. Knowledge of ECS diffusion properties is valuable in contexts ranging from understanding extrasynaptic volume transmission to the development of paradigms for drug delivery to the brain.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) catalyzes the oxidation of one l-arginine guanidinium N atom to nitric oxide (NO). NOS consists of a heme domain linked to a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)/flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) reductase that shuttles electrons from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to the heme. This review summarizes various aspects of NOS structure and function derived from crystal structures coupled with a wealth of biochemical and biophysical data. This includes the binding of diatomic ligands, especially the product, NO, whose binding to the heme iron blocks enzyme activity. An unusual feature of NOS catalysis is the strict requirement for the essential cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B). It now is generally agreed that H4B serves as an electron donor to the heme-oxy complex. The reason NOS may have recruited H4B as an electron transfer cofactor is to provide rapid coupled proton/electron transfer required for O2 activation. NOS is a highly regulated enzyme which is controlled by calmodulin (CaM) at the level of electron transfer within the FMN/FAD reductase and between the reductase and heme domains. Recent crystal structures provide a basis for developing models on the structural underpinnings of NOS regulation. In addition to the complex and fascinating functional and regulatory features of NOS, NOS is an important therapeutic target. Crystal structures have revealed the structural basis of isoform-selective inhibition by a group of dipeptide inhibitors which opens the way for structure-based inhibitor design.},

abstract = {The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is only partially understood. $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) is physiologically generated by sequential cleavage of its precursor protein by the $\beta$- and the $\gamma$-secretase and it is normally disposed of. In Alzheimer's disease, A$\beta$ is excessively produced or less dismissed, but the hypothesis on its physiological and pathological role are heterogeneous and often discordant. It has been described a positive feedback loop from the $\gamma$- to the $\beta$-secretase cleavages of A$\beta$ precursor protein, which is activated by mutations of Presenilin 1 (PS1), the catalytic core of the $\gamma$-secretase. These findings show that A$\beta$ precursor protein as well the activity of the $\gamma$-secretase are required to obtain the up-regulation of $\beta$-secretase which is induced by Presenilin 1 mutations. Then, A$\beta$ 1-42 is the A$\beta$ precursor protein derivative that up-regulates the expression of $\beta$-secretase, and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun and ERK1/2 are involved. Here, we describe the activation of $\beta$-secretase and c-jun N-terminal kinase related proteins by monomeric A$\beta$ 1-42, defining the conditions that most efficiently strike the described signaling without producing toxicity. Taken together these data imply that monomeric A$\beta$ 1-42, at non-toxic concentrations and time frames, are able to induce a signaling pathway that leads to transcriptional activation of $\beta$-secretase.},

abstract = {The coupling between neuronal activity and cerebral blood flow (CBF) is essential for normal brain function. The mechanisms behind this neurovascular coupling process remain elusive, mainly because of difficulties in probing dynamically the functional and coordinated interaction between neurons and the vasculature in vivo. Direct and simultaneous measurements of nitric oxide (NO) dynamics and CBF changes in hippocampus in vivo support the notion that during glutamatergic activation nNOS-derived NO induces a time-, space-, and amplitude-coupled increase in the local CBF, later followed by a transient increase in local O2 tension. These events are dependent on the activation of the NMDA-glutamate receptor and nNOS, without a significant contribution of endothelial-derived NO or astrocyte-neuron signaling pathways. Upon diffusion of NO from active neurons, the vascular response encompasses the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase. Hence, in the hippocampus, neurovascular coupling is mediated by nNOS-derived NO via a diffusional connection between active glutamatergic neurons and blood vessels. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Vascular endothelium expressing endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) produces nitric oxide (NO), which has a number of important physiological functions in the microvasculature. The rate of NO production by the endothelium is a critical determinant of NO distribution in the vascular wall. We have analyzed the biochemical pathways of NO synthesis and formulated a model to estimate NO production by the microvascular endothelium under physiological conditions. The model quantifies the NO produced by eNOS based on the kinetics of NO synthesis and the availability of eNOS and its intracellular substrates. The predicted NO production from microvessels was in the range of 0.005-0.1 microM/s. This range of predicted values is in agreement with some experimental values but is much lower than other rates previously measured or estimated from experimental data with the help of mathematical modeling. Paradoxical discrepancies between the model predictions and previously reported results based on experimental measurements of NO concentration in the vicinity of the arteriolar wall suggest that NO can also be released through eNOS-independent mechanisms, such as catalysis by neuronal NOS (nNOS). We also used our model to test the sensitivity of NO production to substrate availability, eNOS concentration, and potential rate-limiting factors. The results indicated that the predicted low level of NO production can be attributed primarily to a low expression of eNOS in the microvascular endothelial cells.},

An understanding of the mechanisms that link changes in neural activity to changes in blood flow is crucial for assessing the validity of this assumption, and for understanding the processes that can go wrong during disease states such as ischaemic stroke. Many studies have investigated the mechanisms of neurovascular regulation in arterioles but other evidence suggests that blood flow regulation can also occur in capillaries, because of the presence of contractile cells, pericytes, on the capillary wall. Here we review the evidence that pericytes can modulate capillary diameter in response to neuronal activity and assess the likely importance of neurovascular regulation at the capillary level for functional imaging experiments. We also discuss evidence suggesting that pericytes are particularly sensitive to damage during pathological insults such as ischaemia, Alzheimer's disease and diabetic retinopathy, and consider the potential impact that pericyte dysfunction might have on the development of therapeutic interventions and on the interpretation of functional imaging data in these disorders.},

abstract = {A mathematical model of calcium dynamics in vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) was developed based on data mostly from rat mesenteric arterioles. The model focuses on (a) the plasma membrane electrophysiology; (b) Ca2+ uptake and release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR); (c) cytosolic balance of Ca2+, Na+, K+, and Cl ions; and (d) IP3 and cGMP formation in response to norepinephrine(NE) and nitric oxide (NO) stimulation. Stimulation with NE induced membrane depolarization and an intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) transient followed by a plateau. The plateau concentrations were mostly determined by the activation of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. NE causes a greater increase in [Ca2+]i than stimulation with KCl to equivalent depolarization. Model simulations suggest that the effect of[Na+]i accumulation on the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) can potentially account for this difference.Elevation of [Ca2+]i within a concentration window (150-300 nM) by NE or KCl initiated [Ca2+]i oscillations with a concentration-dependent period. The oscillations were generated by the nonlinear dynamics of Ca2+ release and refilling in the SR. NO repolarized the NE-stimulated SMC and restored low [Ca2+]i mainly through its effect on Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Under certain conditions, Na+-K+-ATPase inhibition can result in the elevation of [Na+]i and the reversal of NCX, increasing resting cytosolic and SR Ca2+ content, as well as reactivity to NE. Blockade of the NCX's reverse mode could eliminate these effects. We conclude that the integration of the selected cellular components yields a mathematical model that reproduces, satisfactorily, some of the established features of SMC physiology. Simulations suggest a potential role of intracellular Na+ in modulating Ca2+ dynamics and provide insights into the mechanisms of SMC constriction, relaxation, and the phenomenon of vasomotion. The model will provide the basis for the development of multi-cellular mathematical models that will investigate microcirculatory function in health and disease.},

abstract = {The oxygen exchange and correlation between the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) in the cortical capillary levels for normal and pathologic brain functions remain the subject of debate. A 3D realistic mesoscale model of the cortical capillary network (non-tree like) is constructed using a random Voronoi tessellation in which each edge represents a capillary segment. The hemodynamics and oxygen transport are numerically simulated in the model, which involves rheological laws in the capillaries, oxygen diffusion, and non-linear binding of oxygen to hemoglobin, respectively. The findings show that the cerebral hypoxia due to a significant decreased perfusion (as can occur in stroke) can be avoided by a moderate reduction in oxygen demand. Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) can be an important indicator for the brain oxygen metabolism under normal perfusion and misery-perfusion syndrome (leading to ischemia). The results demonstrated that a disproportionately large increase in blood supply is required for a small increase in the oxygen demand, which, in turn, is strongly dependent on the resting OEF. The predicted flow-metabolism coupling in the model supports the experimental studies of spatiotemporal stimulations in humans by positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging.},

abstract = {Endothelial-derived nitric oxide (NO) is classically viewed as a regulator of vasomotor tone. NO plays an important role in regulating O(2) delivery through paracrine control of vasomotor tone locally and cardiovascular and respiratory responses centrally. Very soon after the cloning and functional characterization of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), studies on the interaction between O(2) and NO made the paradoxical finding that hypoxia led to decreases in eNOS expression and function. Why would decreases in O(2) content in tissues elicit a loss of a potent endothelial-derived vasodilator? We now know that restricting our view of NO as a regulator of vasomotor tone or blood pressure limited deeper levels of mechanistic insight. Exciting new studies indicate that functional interactions between NO and O(2) exhibit profound complexity and are relevant to diseases states, especially those associated with hypoxia in tissues. NOS isoforms catalytically require O(2). Hypoxia regulates steady-state expression of the mRNA and protein abundance of the NOS enzymes. Animals genetically deficient in NOS isoforms have perturbations in their ability to adapt to changes in O(2) supply or demand. Most interestingly, the intracellular pathways for O(2) sensing that evolved to ensure an appropriate balance of O(2) delivery and utilization intersect with NO signaling networks. Recent studies demonstrate that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) stabilization and transcriptional activity is achieved through two parallel pathways: (1) a decrease in O(2)-dependent prolyl hydroxylation of HIF and (2) S-nitrosylation of HIF pathway components. Recent findings support a role for S-nitrosothiols as hypoxia-mimetics in certain biological and/or disease settings, such as living at high altitude, exposure to small molecules that can bind NO, or anemia.},

abstract = {Because regional blood flow increases in association with the increased metabolic demand generated by localized increases in neural activity, functional imaging researchers often assume that changes in blood flow are an accurate read-out of changes in underlying neural activity. An understanding of the mechanisms that link changes in neural activity to changes in blood flow is crucial for assessing the validity of this assumption, and for understanding the processes that can go wrong during disease states such as ischaemic stroke. Many studies have investigated the mechanisms of neurovascular regulation in arterioles but other evidence suggests that blood flow regulation can also occur in capillaries, because of the presence of contractile cells, pericytes, on the capillary wall. Here we review the evidence that pericytes can modulate capillary diameter in response to neuronal activity and assess the likely importance of neurovascular regulation at the capillary level for functional imaging experiments. We also discuss evidence suggesting that pericytes are particularly sensitive to damage during pathological insults such as ischaemia, Alzheimer's disease and diabetic retinopathy, and consider the potential impact that pericyte dysfunction might have on the development of therapeutic interventions and on the interpretation of functional imaging data in these disorders.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with a cascade of pathological events involving formation of amyloid-based neuritic plaques and tau-based neurofibrillary tangles, changes in brain structure and function, and eventually, cognitive impairment and functional disability. The precise sequence of when each of these disease markers becomes abnormal is not yet clearly understood. The present study systematically tested the relationship between classes of biomarkers according to a proposed model of temporal sequence by Jack et al. (Lancet Neurology 9:119-128, 2010). We examined temporal relations among four classes of biomarkers: CSF A$\beta$, CSF tau, neuroimaging variables (hippocampal volume, ventricular volume, FDG PET), and cognitive variables (memory and executive function). Random effects modeling of longitudinal data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was used to test hypotheses that putative earlier markers of AD predicted change in later markers, and that intervening markers reduced effects of earlier on later markers. Specifically, we hypothesized that CSF tau would explain CSF A$\beta$'s relation to neuroimaging and cognitive variables, and neuroimaging variables would explain tau's relation to cognitive variables. Consistent with hypotheses, results indicated that CSF A$\beta$ effects on cognition change were substantially attenuated by CSF tau and measures of brain structure and function, and CSF tau effects on cognitive change were attenuated by neuroimaging variables. Contrary to hypotheses, CSF A$\beta$ and CSF tau were observed to have independent effects on neuroimaging and CSF tau had a direct effect on baseline cognition independent of brain structure and function. These results have implications for clarifying the temporal sequence of AD changes and corresponding biomarkers.},

abstract = {An important issue in synaptic physiology is the extent to which postsynaptic receptors are saturated by the neurotransmitter released from a single synaptic vesicle. Although the bulk of evidence supports receptor saturation, recent studies have started to reveal that alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors may not be saturated by a single vesicle of glutamate. Here, we address this question through a study of putative single synapses, made by hippocampal neurons in culture, that are identified by FM1-43 staining. An analysis of the sources of variability in the amplitudes of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents at single synapses reveals that this variability must arise presynaptically, from variations in the quantity of agonist released. Thus, glutamate receptors at hippocampal synapses are not generally saturated by quantal release.},

abstract = {It has been postulated that the development of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may result from an imbalance between the generation and clearance of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). Although familial AD appears to be caused by Abeta overproduction, sporadic AD (the most prevalent form) may result from impairment in clearance. Recent evidence suggests that several proteases may contribute to the degradation of Abeta. Furthermore, astrocytes have recently been implicated as a potential cellular mediator of Abeta degradation. In this study, we examined the possibility that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), proteases known to be expressed and secreted by astrocytes, could play a role in extracellular Abeta degradation. We found that astrocytes surrounding amyloid plaques showed enhanced expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in aged amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 mice. Moreover, astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) degraded Abeta, lowering levels and producing several fragments after incubation with synthetic human Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42). This activity was attenuated with specific inhibitors of MMP-2 and -9, as well as in ACM derived from mmp-2 or -9 knock-out (KO) mice. In vivo, significant increases in the steady-state levels of Abeta were found in the brains of mmp-2 and -9 KO mice compared with wild-type controls. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the MMPs with N-[(2R)-2-(hydroxamidocarbonylmethyl)-4-methylpentanoyl]-L-tryptophan methylamide (GM 6001) increased brain interstitial fluid Abeta levels and elimination of half-life in APPsw mice. These results suggest that MMP-2 and -9 may contribute to extracellular brain Abeta clearance by promoting Abeta catabolism.},

We present a novel methodology that combines ex-vivo high-resolution micro-computed tomography imaging data with a bioimage informatics algorithm to track and reconstruct the whole-tumor vasculature of a human breast cancer model. The reconstructed tumor vascular network is used as an input of a computational model that estimates blood flow in each segment of the tumor microvascular network. This formulation involves a well-established biophysical model and an optimization algorithm that ensures mass balance and detailed monitoring of all the vessels that feed and drain blood from the tumor microvascular network. Perfusion maps for the whole-tumor microvascular network are computed. Morphological and hemodynamic indices from different regions are compared to infer their role in overall tumor perfusion.},

NO production was described as a combination of a basal production rate term and a shear-dependent term. Our results show that the shear stress-dependence of the production of NO by the endothelium influences the nature of mass transport within the boundary layer. We found that the steady state NO concentration near the endothelial surface exhibits a biphasic dependence on shear stress, in which at low flow, NO concentration decreases owing to the enhanced removal by convective transport while only at higher shear stresses does the increased production cause an increase in NO concentration. The unsteady response to step changes in flow exhibits transient fluctuations in NO that can be explained by time-dependent changes in the diffusive and convective mass transport as the concentration profile evolves. Our results indicate that this model can be used to determine the relationship between shear stress and NO production rate from measurements of NO concentration.},

abstract = {S100B is an EF-hand calcium-binding protein that exerts both intracellular and extracellular effects on a variety of cellular processes. The protein is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system by astrocytes, both physiologically and during the course of neurological disease. In the healthy adult brain and during development, constitutive S100B expression acts as a trophic factor to drive neurite extension and to referee neuroplasticity. Yet, when induced during central nervous system disease, the protein can take on maladaptive roles and thereby exacerbate brain pathology. Based on genetic and pharmacological lines of evidence, we consider such deleterious roles of S100B in two common brain pathologies: ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In rodent models of ischemic brain damage, S100B is induced early on during the subacute phase, where it exacerbates gliosis and delayed infarct expansion and thereby worsens functional recovery. In mouse models of AD, S100B drives brain inflammation and gliosis that accelerate cerebral amyloidosis. Pharmacological inhibition of S100B synthesis mitigates hallmark pathologies of both brain diseases, opening the door for translational approaches to treat these devastating neurological disorders.},

While much is known about molecular mechanisms underlying cerebral A$\beta$ accumulation in familial AD, less is known about the cause(s) of brain amyloidosis in sporadic disease. Animal and postmortem studies suggest that A$\beta$ secretion can be up-regulated in response to hypoxia. We employed a new technology (Single Molecule Arrays, SiMoA) capable of ultrasensitive protein measurements and developed a novel assay to look for changes in serum A$\beta$42 concentration in 25 resuscitated patients with severe hypoxia due to cardiac arrest. After a lag period of 10 or more hours, very clear serum A$\beta$42 elevations were observed in all patients. Elevations ranged from approximately 80\% to over 70-fold, with most elevations in the range of 3-10-fold (average approximately 7-fold). The magnitude of the increase correlated with clinical outcome. These data provide the first direct evidence in living humans that ischemia acutely increases A$\beta$ levels in blood. The results point to the possibility that hypoxia may play a role in the amyloidogenic process of AD.},

In the vasculature NO is released by endothelial cells where it modulates the underlying smooth muscle to regulate vascular tone. Due to the unique chemistry of NO, such as its reactive and free radical nature, it can interact with many different cellular constituents such as thiols and transition metal ions, which determine its cellular actions. In this review we also discuss many of the useful pharmacological tools that have been developed and used extensively to establish the involvement of NO in endothelium-derived relaxations. In addition, the recent literature identifying a potential source of NO in endothelial cells, which is not directly derived from endothelial nitric oxide synthase is examined. Finally, the photorelaxation phenomena, which mediates the release of NO from a vascular smooth muscle NO store, is discussed.},

abstract = {It is well-known that cyclic variations of the vascular diameter, a phenomenon called vasomotion, are induced by synchronous calcium oscillations of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). However, the role of the endothelium on vasomotion is unclear. Some experimental studies claim that the endothelium is necessary for synchronization and vasomotion, whereas others report rhythmic contractions in the absence of an intact endothelium. Moreover, endothelium-derived factors have been shown to abolish vasomotion by desynchronizing the calcium signals in SMCs. By modeling the calcium dynamics of a population of SMCs coupled to a population of endothelial cells, we analyze the effects of an SMC vasoconstrictor stimulation on endothelial cells and the feedback of endothelium-derived factors. Our results show that the endothelium essentially decreases the SMCs calcium level and may move the SMCs from a steady state to an oscillatory domain, and vice versa. In the oscillatory domain, a population of coupled SMCs exhibits synchronous calcium oscillations. Outside the oscillatory domain, the coupled SMCs present only irregular calcium flashings arising from noise modeling stochastic opening of channels. Our findings provide explanations for the published contradictory experimental observations.},

abstract = {Neuronal activity evokes localized changes in blood flow. Although this response, termed neurovascular coupling, is widely used to monitor human brain function and diagnose pathology, the cellular mechanisms that mediate the response remain unclear. We investigated the contribution of glial cells to neurovascular coupling in the acutely isolated mammalian retina. We found that light stimulation and glial cell stimulation can both evoke dilation or constriction of arterioles. Light-evoked and glial-evoked vasodilations were blocked by inhibitors of cytochrome P450 epoxygenase, the synthetic enzyme for epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. Vasoconstrictions, in contrast, were blocked by an inhibitor of omega-hydroxylase, which synthesizes 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Nitric oxide influenced whether vasodilations or vasoconstrictions were produced in response to light and glial stimulation. Light-evoked vasoactivity was blocked when neuron-to-glia signaling was interrupted by a purinergic antagonist. These results indicate that glial cells contribute to neurovascular coupling and suggest that regulation of blood flow may involve both vasodilating and vasoconstricting components.},

abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is formed by brain endothelial cells lining the cerebral microvasculature, and is an important mechanism for protecting the brain from fluctuations in plasma composition, and from circulating agents such as neurotransmitters and xenobiotics capable of disturbing neural function. The barrier also plays an important role in the homeostatic regulation of the brain microenvironment necessary for the stable and co-ordinated activity of neurones. The BBB phenotype develops under the influence of associated brain cells, especially astrocytic glia, and consists of more complex tight junctions than in other capillary endothelia, and a number of specific transport and enzyme systems which regulate molecular traffic across the endothelial cells. Transporters characteristic of the BBB phenotype include both uptake mechanisms (e.g. GLUT-1 glucose carrier, L1 amino acid transporter) and efflux transporters (e.g. P-glycoprotein). In addition to a role in long-term barrier induction and maintenance, astrocytes and other cells can release chemical factors that modulate endothelial permeability over a time-scale of seconds to minutes. Cell culture models, both primary and cell lines, have been used to investigate aspects of barrier induction and modulation. Conditioned medium taken from growing glial cells can reproduce some of the inductive effects, evidence for involvement of diffusible factors. However, for some features of endothelial differentiation and induction, the extracellular matrix plays an important role. Several candidate molecules have been identified, capable of mimicking aspects of glial-mediated barrier induction of brain endothelium; these include TGFbeta, GDNF, bFGF, IL-6 and steroids. In addition, factors secreted by brain endothelial cells including leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) have been shown to induce astrocytic differentiation. Thus endothelium and astrocytes are involved in two-way induction. Short-term modulation of brain endothelial permeability has been shown for a number of small chemical mediators produced by astrocytes and other nearby cell types. It is clear that endothelial cells are involved in both long- and short-term chemical communication with neighbouring cells, with the perivascular end feet of astrocytes being of particular importance. The role of barrier induction and modulation in normal physiology and in pathology is discussed.},

abstract = {Normal brain function requires proper supply of oxygen and glucose in a timely and local manner. This is achieved through an orchestrated intercellular communication between neurones, astrocytes and microvessels that results in a rapid and restricted increase in cerebral blood flow, a process known as neurovascular coupling. Astrocytic end-feet make close contacts with neuronal synapses and blood vessels and, given their ability to release vasoactive signals following neuronal activation, have been recognized as key intermediaries in the neurovascular response. Both dilating and constricting signals appear to be released from astrocytes upon increases in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, and both dilatation and constriction of brain vessels have been observed in previous studies. In this article, we discuss the various astrocyte-derived vasodilating and vasoconstricting signals, their interactions and effects on astrocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, and suggest the importance of the intrinsic properties of the latter cell type on the overall neurovascular response. We present a working model in which the rise in astrocytic Ca(2+) following neuronal activation leads not only to the rapid activation of calcium-activated K(+) channels in astrocytic end-feet, but also to their modulation by metabolites of the arachidonic acid pathway, which in general have been proposed to act on vascular smooth muscle cells rather than on astrocytes. We propose that this latter mechanism may in turn modulate K(+) signalling from astrocytes to smooth muscle cells, influencing the overall effects of the vasodilating and vasoconstricting signals released during neuronal activation.},

abstract = {Because regional blood flow increases in association with the increased metabolic demand generated by localized increases in neural activity, functional imaging researchers often assume that changes in blood flow are an accurate read-out of changes in underlying neural activity. An understanding of the mechanisms that link changes in neural activity to changes in blood flow is crucial for assessing the validity of this assumption, and for understanding the processes that can go wrong during disease states such as ischaemic stroke. Many studies have investigated the mechanisms of neurovascular regulation in arterioles but other evidence suggests that blood flow regulation can also occur in capillaries, because of the presence of contractile cells, pericytes, on the capillary wall. Here we review the evidence that pericytes can modulate capillary diameter in response to neuronal activity and assess the likely importance of neurovascular regulation at the capillary level for functional imaging experiments. We also discuss evidence suggesting that pericytes are particularly sensitive to damage during pathological insults such as ischaemia, Alzheimer's disease and diabetic retinopathy, and consider the potential impact that pericyte dysfunction might have on the development of therapeutic interventions and on the interpretation of functional imaging data in these disorders.},

A central autoregulation mechanism observed in this unit is functional hyperemia, in which the microvasculature dilates in response to local neural activity in order to meet the increased demand for blood flow and oxygen. We have developed the first interactional model of bidirectional signaling in the neurovascular unit. The vascular model includes a description of vasomotion, the vascular oscillatory response to transmural pressure, observed in vivo. The communication mechanisms in the model include neural synaptic glutamate and potassium signaling to the astrocytes, potassium signaling from the astrocyte to the microvasculature, and astrocytic mechanosensation of vascular changes. The model response of the astrocyte to arteriolar dilation is validated with recent in vivo and in vitro experimental results. The model reproduces for the first time the in vitro observed phenomenon in which arteriole radius and Ca(2+) oscillations, "vasomotion," are damped due to neural induced astrocytic signaling.},

We have made an electron microscopic 3D reconstruction of perivascular endfeet in CA1 (stratum moleculare) of rat hippocampus. The endfeet interdigitate and overlap, leaving no slits between them. Only in a few sites do processes--tentatively classified as processes of microglia--extend through the perivascular glial sheath to establish direct contact with the endothelial basal lamina. In contrast to the endfoot covering of the endothelial tube, the endfoot covering of the pericyte is incomplete, allowing neuropil elements to touch the basal lamina that enwraps this type of cell. The 3D reconstruction also revealed large bundles of mitochondria in the endfoot processes that came in close apposition to the perivascular endfoot membrane. Our data support the idea that in pathophysiological conditions, the perivascular astrocytic covering may control the exchange of water and solutes between blood and brain and that free diffusion is limited to narrow clefts between overlapping endfeet.},

abstract = {Normal brain function requires proper supply of oxygen and glucose in a timely and local manner. This is achieved through an orchestrated intercellular communication between neurones, astrocytes and microvessels that results in a rapid and restricted increase in cerebral blood flow, a process known as neurovascular coupling. Astrocytic end-feet make close contacts with neuronal synapses and blood vessels and, given their ability to release vasoactive signals following neuronal activation, have been recognized as key intermediaries in the neurovascular response. Both dilating and constricting signals appear to be released from astrocytes upon increases in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, and both dilatation and constriction of brain vessels have been observed in previous studies. In this article, we discuss the various astrocyte-derived vasodilating and vasoconstricting signals, their interactions and effects on astrocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, and suggest the importance of the intrinsic properties of the latter cell type on the overall neurovascular response. We present a working model in which the rise in astrocytic Ca(2+) following neuronal activation leads not only to the rapid activation of calcium-activated K(+) channels in astrocytic end-feet, but also to their modulation by metabolites of the arachidonic acid pathway, which in general have been proposed to act on vascular smooth muscle cells rather than on astrocytes. We propose that this latter mechanism may in turn modulate K(+) signalling from astrocytes to smooth muscle cells, influencing the overall effects of the vasodilating and vasoconstricting signals released during neuronal activation.},

The presence of hypertension and other vascular risk factors has been associated with decreased performance in executive function and attention tests. Cerebrovascular reserve has emerged as a potential biomarker for monitoring pressure-perfusion-cognition relationships. A decline in vascular reserve capacity can lead to impaired neurovascular coupling and decreased cognitive ability. Endothelial dysfunction, microvascular disease, and mascrovascular disease in midlife could also have an important role in the manifestations and severity of multiple medical conditions underlying cognitive decline late in life. However, questions remain about the role of antihypertensive therapies for long-term prevention of cognitive decline.

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule that is widely used in the nervous system. With recognition of its roles in synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation, LTP; long-term depression, LTD) and elucidation of calcium-dependent, NMDAR-mediated activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), numerous molecular and pharmacological tools have been used to explore the physiology and pathological consequences for nitrergic signaling. In this review, the authors summarize the current understanding of this subtle signaling pathway, discuss the evidence for nitrergic modulation of ion channels and homeostatic modulation of intrinsic excitability, and speculate about the pathological consequences of spillover between different nitrergic compartments in contributing to aberrant signaling in neurodegenerative disorders. Accumulating evidence points to various ion channels and particularly voltage-gated potassium channels as signaling targets, whereby NO mediates activity-dependent control of intrinsic neuronal excitability; such changes could underlie broader mechanisms of synaptic plasticity across neuronal networks. In addition, the inability to constrain NO diffusion suggests that spillover from endothelium (eNOS) and/or immune compartments (iNOS) into the nervous system provides potential pathological sources of NO and where control failure in these other systems could have broader neurological implications. Abnormal NO signaling could therefore contribute to a variety of neurodegenerative pathologies such as stroke/excitotoxicity, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease.},

Ultimately, this would lead to BBB compromise, to chemical imbalance in the neuronal environment and to synaptic and neuronal dysfunction, injury and loss. Based on the neurovascular hypothesis, I suggest an array of new potential therapeutic approaches that could be developed for AD, to enhance A beta clearance and neurovascular repair, and to protect the neurovascular unit from divergent inducers of injury and apoptosis.},

Although the bulk of evidence supports receptor saturation, recent studies have started to reveal that alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors may not be saturated by a single vesicle of glutamate. Here, we address this question through a study of putative single synapses, made by hippocampal neurons in culture, that are identified by FM1-43 staining. An analysis of the sources of variability in the amplitudes of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents at single synapses reveals that this variability must arise presynaptically, from variations in the quantity of agonist released. Thus, glutamate receptors at hippocampal synapses are not generally saturated by quantal release.},

abstract = {The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is only partially understood. $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) is physiologically generated by sequential cleavage of its precursor protein by the $\beta$- and the $\gamma$-secretase and it is normally disposed of. In Alzheimer's disease, A$\beta$ is excessively produced or less dismissed, but the hypothesis on its physiological and pathological role are heterogeneous and often discordant. It has been described a positive feedback loop from the $\gamma$- to the $\beta$-secretase cleavages of A$\beta$ precursor protein, which is activated by mutations of Presenilin 1 (PS1), the catalytic core of the $\gamma$-secretase. These findings show that A$\beta$ precursor protein as well the activity of the $\gamma$-secretase are required to obtain the up-regulation of $\beta$-secretase which is induced by Presenilin 1 mutations. Then, A$\beta$ 1-42 is the A$\beta$ precursor protein derivative that up-regulates the expression of $\beta$-secretase, and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun and ERK1/2 are involved. Here, we describe the activation of $\beta$-secretase and c-jun N-terminal kinase related proteins by monomeric A$\beta$ 1-42, defining the conditions that most efficiently strike the described signaling without producing toxicity. Taken together these data imply that monomeric A$\beta$ 1-42, at non-toxic concentrations and time frames, are able to induce a signaling pathway that leads to transcriptional activation of $\beta$-secretase.},

abstract = {Fast excitatory synapses are generally thought to act as private communication channels between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. Some recent findings, however, suggest that glutamate may diffuse out of the synaptic cleft and bind to several subtypes of receptors, either in the perisynaptic membrane or at neighboring synapses. it is not known whether activation of these receptors can occur in response to the release of a single vesicle of glutamate. Here we estimate the spatiotemporal profile of glutamate in the extrasynaptic space after vesicle exocytosis, guided by detailed ultrastructural measurements of the CA1 neuropil in the adult rat. We argue that the vicinity of the synapse can be treated as an isotropic porous medium, in which diffusion is determined by the extracellular volume fraction and the tortuosity factor, and develop novel stereological methods to estimate these parameters. We also estimate the spatial separation between synapses, to ask whether glutamate released at one synapse can activate NMDA and other high-affinity receptors at a neighboring synapse. Kinetic simulations of extrasynaptic glutamate uptake show that transporters rapidly reduce the free concentration of transmitter. Exocytosis of a single vesicle is, however, sufficient to bind to high-affinity receptors situated in the immediate perisynaptic space. The distance separating a typical synapse from its nearest neighbor is similar to 465 nm. Whether glutamate can reach a sufficient concentration to activate NMDA receptors at this distance depends critically on the diffusion coefficient in the extracellular space. If diffusion is much slower than in free aqueous solution, NMDA receptors could mediate crosstalk between neighboring synapses.},

abstract = {Evidence is fast accumulating which indicates that Alzheimer's disease is a vascular disorder with neurodegenerative consequences rather than a neurodegenerative disorder with vascular consequences. It is proposed that two factors need to be present for AD to develop: (1) advanced ageing, (2) presence of a condition that lowers cerebral perfusion, such as a vascular-risk factor. The first factor introduces a normal but potentially insidious process that lowers cerebral blood flow in inverse relation to increased ageing; the second factor adds a crucial burden which further lowers brain perfusion and places vulnerable neurons in a state of high energy compromise leading to a cascade of neuronal metabolic turmoil. Convergence of the two factors above will culminate in a critically attained threshold of cerebral hypoperfusion (CATCH). CATCH is a hemodynamic microcirculatory insufficiency that will destabilize neurons, synapses, neurotransmission and cognitive function, creating in its wake a neurodegenerative state characterized by the formation of senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid angiopathy and in some cases, Lewy bodies. Since any of a considerable number of vascular-related conditions must be present in the ageing individual for cognition to be disturbed, CATCH identifies an important aspect of the heterogeneic disease profile assumed to be present in the AD syndrome. It is proposed that CATCH initiates AD by distorting regional brain capillary structure involving endothelial cell shape changes and impairment of nitric oxide (NO) release which affect signaling between the immune, cardiovascular and nervous systems. Evidence is presented that in many tissues there is a basal level of NO being produced and that the actions of several signaling molecules may initiate increases in basal NO levels. Moreover, these temporary increases in basal NO levels exert inhibitory cellular actions, via cellular conformational changes. Findings indicate that (a) constitutive NO is responsible for a basal or 'tonal' level of NO; (b) this NO keeps particular types of cells in a state of inhibition and (c) activation of these cells occurs through disinhibition. Consequently, tissues not maintaining a basal NO level are more prone to excitatory, immune, vascular and neural influences. Under such circumstances, these tissues cannot be down-regulated to normal basal levels, thus prolonging their excitatory state. Thus, the clinical convergence of advanced ageing in the presence of a chronic, pre-morbid vascular risk factor, can, in time, contribute to an endotheliopathy involving basal NO deficit, to the degree where regional metabolic dysfunction leads to cognitive meltdown and to progressive neurodegeneration characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.

abstract = {A numerical model of neurovascular coupling (NVC) is presented based on neuronal activity coupled to vasodilation/contraction models via the astrocytic mediated perivascular K(+) and the smooth muscle cell Ca(2+) pathway. Luminal agonists acting on P2Y receptors on the endothelial cell surface provide a flux of IP3 into the endothelial cytosol. This concentration of IP3 is transported via gap junctions between endothelial and smooth muscle cells providing a source of sacroplasmic derived Ca(2+) in the smooth muscle cell. The model is able to relate a neuronal input signal to the corresponding vessel reaction. Results indicate that blood flow mediated IP3 production via the agonist ATP has a substantial effect on the contraction/dilation dynamics of the SMC. The resulting variation in cytosolic Ca(2+) can enhance and inhibit the flow of blood to the cortical tissue. IP3 coupling between endothelial and smooth muscle cells seems to be important in the dynamics of the smooth muscle cell. The VOCC channels are, due to the hyperpolarisation from K(+) SMC efflux, almost entirely closed and do not seem to play a significant role during neuronal activity. The current model shows that astrocytic Ca(2+) is not necessary for neurovascular coupling to occur in contrast to a number of experiments outlining the importance of astrocytic Ca(2+) in NVC, however this Ca(2+) pathway is not the only one mediating NVC. Importantly agonists in flowing blood have a significant influence on the endothelial and smooth muscle cell dynamics.},

abstract = {The K(ir)4.1 channel is crucial for the maintenance of the resting membrane potential of glial cells, and it is believed to play a main role in the homeostasis of extracellular potassium. To understand its importance in these two phenomena, we have measured in vivo the variations of extracellular potassium concentration ([K(+)](o)) (with potassium-sensitive microelectrodes) and membrane potential of glial cells (with sharp electrodes) during stimulations in wild-type (WT) mice and glial-conditional knock-out (cKO) K(ir)4.1 mice. The conditional knockout was driven by the human glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter, gfa2. Experiments were performed in the hippocampus of anesthetized mice (postnatal days 17-24). Low level stimulation (<20 stimuli, 10 Hz) induced a moderated increase of [K(+)](o) (<2 mm increase) in both WT and cKO mice. However, cKO mice exhibited slower recovery of [K(+)](o) levels. With long-lasting stimulation (300 stimuli, 10 Hz), [K(+)](o) in WT and cKO mice displayed characteristic ceiling level (>2 mm increase) and recovery undershoot, with a more pronounced and prolonged undershoot in cKO mice. In addition, cKO glial cells were more depolarized, and, in contrast to those from WT mice, their membrane potential did not follow the stimulation-induced [K(+)](o) changes, reflecting the loss of their high potassium permeability. Our in vivo results support the role of K(ir)4.1 in setting the membrane potential of glial cells and its contribution to the glial potassium permeability. In addition, our data confirm the necessity of the K(ir)4.1 channel for an efficient uptake of K(+) by glial cells.},

abstract = {Vascular cells communicate electrically to coordinate their activity and control tissue blood flow. To foster a quantitative understanding of this fundamental process, we developed a computational model that was structured to mimic a skeletal muscle resistance artery. Each endothelial cell and smooth muscle cell in our virtual artery was treated as the electrical equivalent of a capacitor coupled in parallel with a non-linear resistor representing ionic conductance; intercellular gap junctions were represented by ohmic resistors. Simulations revealed that the vessel wall is not a syncytium in which electrical stimuli spread equally to all constitutive cells. Indeed, electrical signals spread in a differential manner among and between endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells according to the initial stimulus. The predictions of our model agree with physiological data from the feed artery of the hamster retractor muscle. Cell orientation and coupling resistance were the principal factors that enable electrical signals to spread differentially along and between the two cell types. Our computational observations also illustrated how gap junctional coupling enables the vessel wall to filter and transform transient electrical events into sustained voltage responses. Functionally, differential electrical communication would permit discrete regions of smooth muscle activity to locally regulate blood flow and the endothelium to coordinate regional changes in tissue perfusion.},

abstract = {The link between atherosclerosis and regions of disturbed flow and low wall shear stress is now firmly established, but the causal mechanisms underlying the link are not yet understood. It is now recognised that the endothelium is not simply a passive barrier between the blood and the vessel wall, but plays an active role in maintaining vascular homeostasis and participates in the onset of atherosclerosis. Calcium signalling is one of the principal intracellular signalling mechanisms by which endothelial cells (EC) respond to external stimuli, such as fluid shear stress and ligand binding. Previous studies have separately modelled mass transport of chemical species in the bloodstream and calcium dynamics in EC via the inositol trisphosphate (IP(3)) signalling pathway. We review existing models of these two phenomena, before going on to integrate the two components to provide an inclusive new model for the calcium response of the endothelium in an arbitrary vessel geometry. This enables the combined effects of fluid flow and biochemical stimulation on EC to be investigated and is the first time spatially varying, physiological fluid flow-related environmental factors have been combined with intracellular signalling in a mathematical model. Model results show that low endothelial calcium levels in the area of disturbed flow at an arterial widening may be one contributing factor to the onset of vascular disease.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. In connection with the global trend of prolonging human life and the increasing number of elderly in the population, the AD becomes one of the most serious health and socioeconomic problems of the present. Tau protein promotes assembly and stabilizes microtubules, which contributes to the proper function of neuron. Alterations in the amount or the structure of tau protein can affect its role as a stabilizer of microtubules as well as some of the processes in which it is implicated. The molecular mechanisms governing tau aggregation are mainly represented by several posttranslational modifications that alter its structure and conformational state. Hence, abnormal phosphorylation and truncation of tau protein have gained attention as key mechanisms that become tau protein in a pathological entity. Evidences about the clinicopathological significance of phosphorylated and truncated tau have been documented during the progression of AD as well as their capacity to exert cytotoxicity when expressed in cell and animal models. This paper describes the normal structure and function of tau protein and its major alterations during its pathological aggregation in AD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a risk factor for dementia. It is unknown whether higher glucose levels increase the risk of dementia in people without diabetes.

METHODS: We used 35,264 clinical measurements of glucose levels and 10,208 measurements of glycated hemoglobin levels from 2067 participants without dementia to examine the relationship between glucose levels and the risk of dementia. Participants were from the Adult Changes in Thought study and included 839 men and 1228 women whose mean age at baseline was 76 years; 232 participants had diabetes, and 1835 did not. We fit Cox regression models, stratified according to diabetes status and adjusted for age, sex, study cohort, educational level, level of exercise, blood pressure, and status with respect to coronary and cerebrovascular diseases, atrial fibrillation, smoking, and treatment for hypertension.

RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 6.8 years, dementia developed in 524 participants (74 with diabetes and 450 without). Among participants without diabetes, higher average glucose levels within the preceding 5 years were related to an increased risk of dementia (P=0.01); with a glucose level of 115 mg per deciliter (6.4 mmol per liter) as compared with 100 mg per deciliter (5.5 mmol per liter), the adjusted hazard ratio for dementia was 1.18 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 1.33). Among participants with diabetes, higher average glucose levels were also related to an increased risk of dementia (P=0.002); with a glucose level of 190 mg per deciliter (10.5 mmol per liter) as compared with 160 mg per deciliter (8.9 mmol per liter), the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.40 (95\% CI, 1.12 to 1.76).

CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that higher glucose levels may be a risk factor for dementia, even among persons without diabetes. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.)},

abstract = {Neuronal stimulation causes approximately 30\% shrinkage of the extracellular space (ECS) between neurons and surrounding astrocytes in grey and white matter under experimental conditions. Despite its possible implications for a proper understanding of basic aspects of potassium clearance and astrocyte function, the phenomenon remains unexplained. Here we present a dynamic model that accounts for current experimental data related to the shrinkage phenomenon in wild-type as well as in gene knockout individuals. We find that neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride in passive channels, action of the Na/K/ATPase pump, and osmotically driven transport of water through the astrocyte membrane together seem sufficient for generating ECS shrinkage as such. However, when taking into account ECS and astrocyte ion concentrations observed in connection with neuronal stimulation, the actions of the Na(+)/K(+)/Cl(-) (NKCC1) and the Na(+)/HCO(3) (-) (NBC) cotransporters appear to be critical determinants for achieving observed quantitative levels of ECS shrinkage. Considering the current state of knowledge, the model framework appears sufficiently detailed and constrained to guide future key experiments and pave the way for more comprehensive astroglia-neuron interaction models for normal as well as pathophysiological situations.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is a relative newcomer to pharmacology, as the paper which initiated the field was published only 25 years ago. Nevertheless its impact is such that to date more than 31,000 papers have been published with NO in the title and more than 65,000 refer to it in some way. The identification of NO with endothelium-derived relaxing factor and the discovery of its synthesis from L-arginine led to the realisation that the L-arginine: NO pathway is widespread and plays a variety of physiological roles. These include the maintenance of vascular tone, neurotransmitter function in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, and mediation of cellular defence. In addition, NO interacts with mitochondrial systems to regulate cell respiration and to augment the generation of reactive oxygen species, thus triggering mechanisms of cell survival or death. This review will focus on the role of NO in the cardiovascular system where, in addition to maintaining a vasodilator tone, it inhibits platelet aggregation and adhesion and modulates smooth muscle cell proliferation. NO has been implicated in a number of cardiovascular diseases and virtually every risk factor for these appears to be associated with a reduction in endothelial generation of NO. Reduced basal NO synthesis or action leads to vasoconstriction, elevated blood pressure and thrombus formation. By contrast, overproduction of NO leads to vasodilatation, hypotension, vascular leakage, and disruption of cell metabolism. Appropriate pharmacological or molecular biological manipulation of the generation of NO will doubtless prove beneficial in such conditions.},

abstract = {Quantification of nonlinear interactions between two nonstationary signals presents a computational challenge in different research fields, especially for assessments of physiological systems. Traditional approaches that are based on theories of stationary signals cannot resolve nonstationarity-related issues and, thus, cannot reliably assess nonlinear interactions in physiological systems. In this review we discuss a new technique "Multi-Modal Pressure Flow method (MMPF)" that utilizes Hilbert-Huang transformation to quantify dynamic cerebral autoregulation (CA) by studying interaction between nonstationary cerebral blood flow velocity (BFV) and blood pressure (BP). CA is an important mechanism responsible for controlling cerebral blood flow in responses to fluctuations in systemic BP within a few heart-beats. The influence of CA is traditionally assessed from the relationship between the well-pronounced systemic BP and BFV oscillations induced by clinical tests. Reliable noninvasive assessment of dynamic CA, however, remains a challenge in clinical and diagnostic medicine.In this brief review we: 1) present an overview of transfer function analysis (TFA) that is traditionally used to quantify CA; 2) describe the a MMPF method and its modifications; 3) introduce a newly developed automatic algorithm and engineering aspects of the improved MMPF method; and 4) review clinical applications of MMPF and its sensitivity for detection of CA abnormalities in clinical studies. The MMPF analysis decomposes complex nonstationary BP and BFV signals into multiple empirical modes adaptively so that the fluctuations caused by a specific physiologic process can be represented in a corresponding empirical mode. Using this technique, we recently showed that dynamic CA can be characterized by specific phase delays between the decomposed BP and BFV oscillations, and that the phase shifts are significantly reduced in hypertensive, diabetics and stroke subjects with impaired CA. In addition, the new technique enables reliable assessment of CA using both data collected during clinical test and spontaneous BP/BFV fluctuations during baseline resting conditions.},

abstract = {1. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded under whole-cell voltage clamp from granule cells in slices of rat cerebellum. EPSCs from individual mossy fibre inputs were identified by their all-or-none appearance in response to a graded stimulus. Excitatory synaptic transmission was investigated at room temperature (approximately 24 degrees C) and at near-physiological temperature (approximately 34 degrees C) by analysing current fluctuations in the peak and decay of the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (non-NMDA) component of EPSCs. 2. In a subset of synapses the mean EPSC amplitude remained unchanged as the probability of transmitter release was substantially lowered by raising the extracellular Mg2+ and lowering Ca2+. These synapses were considered to have only one functional release site. Single-site synapses had small EPSCs (139 16 pS, n = 5, at 24 degrees C) with a large coefficient of variation (c.v. = 0.23 0.02, n = 5) and an amplitude distribution that was well fitted by a Gaussian distribution in four out of five cases. The EPSC latency had a unimodal distribution and its standard deviation had a temperature dependence with a temperature coefficient (Q10; range, 24-35 degrees C) of 2.4 0.4 (n = 4). 3. Peak-scaled non-stationary fluctuation analysis of single-site EPSCs indicated that the mean conductance of the underlying non-NMDA channels was 12 2 pS (n = 4) at 35 degrees C. Upper and lower limits for mean channel open probability (Po), calculated from fluctuations in the EPSC peak amplitude, were 0.51 and 0.38, respectively. These estimates, together with the open probability of the channel when bound by transmitter, suggest that only about 50\% of the non-NMDA channels were occupied following the release of a quantum of transmitter. 4. At some multi-site synapses EPSCs had a low c.v. (0.4 0.01, n = 5) at 34 degrees C and non-stationary fluctuation analysis gave a parabolic variance-mean current relationship. This suggests that practically all of the non-NMDA receptors were occupied by glutamate at the peak of EPSC. The channel open probability (Po = 0.84 0.03, n = 5) at these 'saturated' multi-site synapses will therefore equal the open probability of the channel when bound by transmitter (Po,max). 5. Non-stationary fluctuation analysis of EPSCs from 'saturating' multi-site synapses indicated that 170 40 postsynaptic non-NMDA channels were exposed to transmitter at the peak of the EPSC. The mean conductance of the synaptic channels was 10 2 pS (n = 5) at 34 degrees C. 6. At synapses with multiple release sites the EPSC decay time became faster when release probability was lowered (by reducing the external Ca2+/Mg2+ ratio), indicating that the transmitter concentration profile depended on release probability. No such speeding of the EPSC decay was observed at single-site synapses. 7. Our results suggest that release of a packet of transmitter from a single release site does not saturate postsynaptic non-NMDA receptors at cerebellar mossy fibre-granule cell synapses. However, at multi-site synapses transmitter released from neighbouring sites can overlap, changing the transmitter concentration profile in the synaptic cleft. We conclude that the level of postsynaptic receptor occupancy can depend on the probability of transmitter release at individual multi-site synapses.},

abstract = {Spontaneous contraction and relaxation of arteries (and in some instances venules) has been termed vasomotion and has been observed in an extensive variety of tissues and species. However, its functions and underlying mechanisms are still under discussion. We demonstrate that in vivo spectrophotometry, measured simultaneously with extracellular recordings at the same locations in the visual thalamus of the cat, reveals vasomotion, measured as an oscillation (0.14 hz) in the recorded oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) signal, which appears spontaneously in the microcirculation and can last for periods of hours. During some non-oscillatory periods, maintained sensory stimulation evokes vasomotion lasting \~{}30s, resembling an adaptive vascular phenomenon. This oscillation in the oxyhaemoblobin signal is sensitive to pharmacological manipulation: it is inducible by chloralose anaesthesia and it can be temporarily blocked by systemic administration of adrenaline or acetylcholine (ACh). During these oscillatory periods, neurovascular coupling (i.e. the relationship between local neural activity and the rate of blood supply to that location) appears significantly altered. This raises important questions with regard to the interpretation of results from studies currently dependent upon a linear relationship between neural activity and blood flow, such as neuroimaging.},

@article{Eliasson1999,
abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is a new intercellular messenger that occurs naturally in the brain without causing overt toxicity. Yet, NO has been implicated as a mediator of cell death in cell death. One explanation is that ischemia causes overproduction of NO, allowing it to react with superoxide to form the potent oxidant peroxynitrite. To address this question, we used immunohistochemistry for citrulline, a marker for NO synthase activity, and 3-nitrotyrosine, a marker for peroxynitrite formation, in mice subjected to reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion. We show that ischemia triggers a marked augmentation in citrulline immunoreactivity but more so in the peri-infarct than the infarcted tissue. This increase is attributable to the activation of a large population (approximately 80\%) of the neuronal isoform of NO synthase (nNOS) that is catalytically inactive during basal conditions, indicating a tight regulation of physiological NO production in the brain. In contrast, 3-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity is restricted to the infarcted tissue and is not present in the peri-infarct tissue. In nNOS(Delta/Delta) mice, known to be protected against ischemia, no 3-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity is detected. Our findings provide a cellular localization for nNOS activation in association with ischemic stroke and establish that NO is not likely a direct neurotoxin, whereas its conversion to peroxynitrite is associated with cell death.},

abstract = {Dualistic effects of acetylcholine-esterase inhibitors on neuronal as well as vasoregulative function have been debated. This study investigated for the first time effects of medication on both components. Visually evoked potentials and resultant hemodynamic responses were assessed in Alzheimer patients (n=31) without vascular lesions in a MRI scan and compared to controls (n=20). After baseline recordings (AD0) tests were repeated under 2x1.5 to 2x3mg (AD1) and 2x4.5 to 2x6mg (AD2) rivastigmine/d. Long-term effects were investigated under 6 months of medication (AD2L). The ADAS, MMSE and DEMTECT were used to assess cognitive function at AD0, AD2 and AD2L. Improvement in vasoregulative function was independent from changes in evoked potentials. Acetylcholine-esterase inhibitors demonstrate substantial vascular effects in humans, which are independent from changes in neuronal function.},

abstract = {Following stimulation of NMDA receptors, neurons transiently synthesize nitric oxide (NO) in a calcium/calmodulin-dependent manner through the activation of neuronal NO synthase. Nitric oxide acts as a messenger, activating soluble guanylyl cyclase and participating in the transduction signalling pathways involving cyclic GMP. Nitric oxide also binds to cytochrome c oxidase, and is able to inhibit cell respiration in a process that is reversible and in competition with oxygen. This action can also lead to the release of superoxide anion from the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Here, we discuss recent evidence that this mitochondrial interaction represents a molecular switch for cell signalling pathways involved in the control of physiological functions. These include superoxide- or oxygen-dependent modulation of gene transcription, calcium-dependent cell signalling responses, changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential or AMP-activated protein kinase-dependent control of glycolysis. In pathophysiological conditions, such as brain ischaemia or neurological disorders, NO is formed excessively by NMDA receptor over-activation in neurons, or by inducible NO synthase from neighbouring glia (microglial cells and astrocytes). Elevated NO concentrations can then interact with superoxide anion, generated by the mitochondria or by other mechanisms, leading to the formation of the powerful oxidant species peroxynitrite. During pathological conditions activation of the NAD(+)-consuming enzyme poly(APD-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is also a likely mechanism for NO-mediated energy failure and neurotoxicity. Activation of PARP-1 is, however, a repair process, which in milder forms of oxidative stress protects neurons from death. Thus, whilst NO plays a physiological role in neuronal cell signalling, its over-production may cause neuronal energy compromise leading to neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Cerebral autoregulation (CA) is an most important mechanism responsible for the relatively constant blood flow supply to brain when cerebral perfusion pressure varies. Its assessment in nonacute cases has been relied on the quantification of the relationship between noninvasive beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) and blood flow velocity (BFV). To overcome the nonstationary nature of physiological signals such as BP and BFV, a computational method called multimodal pressure-flow (MMPF) analysis was recently developed to study the nonlinear BP-BFV relationship during the Valsalva maneuver (VM). The present study aimed to determine (i) whether this method can estimate autoregulation from spontaneous BP and BFV fluctuations during baseline rest conditions; (ii) whether there is any difference between the MMPF measures of autoregulation based on intra-arterial BP (ABP) and based on cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP); and (iii) whether the MMPF method provides reproducible and reliable measure for noninvasive assessment of autoregulation. To achieve these aims, we analyzed data from existing databases including: (i) ABP and BFV of 12 healthy control, 10 hypertensive, and 10 stroke subjects during baseline resting conditions and during the Valsalva maneuver, and (ii) ABP, CPP, and BFV of 30 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who were being paralyzed, sedated, and ventilated. We showed that autoregulation in healthy control subjects can be characterized by specific phase shifts between BP and BFV oscillations during the Valsalva maneuver, and the BP-BFV phase shifts were reduced in hypertensive and stroke subjects (P < 0.01), indicating impaired autoregulation. Similar results were found during baseline condition from spontaneous BP and BFV oscillations. The BP-BFV phase shifts obtained during baseline and during VM were highly correlated (R > 0.8, P < 0.0001), showing no statistical difference (paired-t test P > 0.47). In TBI patients there were strong correlations between phases of ABP and CPP oscillations (R = 0.99, P < 0.0001) and, thus, between ABP-BFV and CPP-BFV phase shifts (P < 0.0001, R = 0.76). By repeating the MMPF 4 times on data of TBI subjects, each time on a selected cycle of spontaneous BP and BFV oscillations, we showed that MMPF had better reproducibility than traditional autoregulation index. These results indicate that the MMPF method, based on instantaneous phase relationships between cerebral blood flow velocity and peripheral blood pressure, has better performance than the traditional standard method, and can reliably assess cerebral autoregulation dynamics from ambulatory blood pressure and cerebral blood flow during supine rest conditions.},

The challenge is to unravel the link. Here we show, using spectrophotometry to record oxyhaemoglobin and methemoglobin (surrogate markers of cerebral flow and nitric oxide levels respectively) together with extracellular neuronal recordings in vivo and applying a multiple polynomial regression model, that the markers are able to predict up about 80\% of variability in NR. Furthermore, we show that the coupling between blood flow and neuronal activity is heavily influenced by nitric oxide (NO). While NRs show the typical saturating response, blood flow shows a linear behaviour during contrast-response curves, with nitric oxide from different sources acting differently for low and high intensity.},

abstract = {In spite of intense recent investigation of the physiological and pathophysiological roles of endogenously produced nitric oxide (.NO) in mammalian systems, little quantitative information exists concerning the diffusion of this small nonelectrolyte from its source (NO synthase) to its targets of action. I present here a conceptual framework for analyzing the intracellular and intercellular diffusion and reaction of free .NO, using kinetic modeling and calculations of the diffusibility of .NO and its reactions in aqueous solution based on published data. If the half-life of .NO is greater than approximately 25 msec and the rates of reaction of .NO with its targets are slower than its diffusion or reaction with O2 (for which there is experimental evidence in at least some systems), then (i) .NO acts in vivo in a mostly paracrine fashion for a collection of .NO-producing cells, (ii) .NO diffuses to significant concentrations at distances relatively far removed from a single .NO-producing cell, and (iii) localized sites of vascularization will scavenge .NO (and thus decrease its actions) at distances many cell diameters away from that site. These conclusions have important implications with regard to the mechanism of endothelium-dependent relaxation, the autocrine vs. paracrine actions of .NO, and the role of the spatial relationship between specific sites of .NO formation and neighboring blood vessels in .NO-effected and -affected neuronal signal transmission.},

@article{McMurry2011,
abstract = {Using interferometry-based biosensors the binding and release of endothelial and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (eNOS and nNOS) from calmodulin (CaM) was measured. In both isoforms, binding to CaM is diffusion limited and within approximately three orders of magnitude of the Smoluchowski limit imposed by orientation-independent collisions. This suggests that the orientation of CaM is facilitated by the charge arrays on the CaM-binding site and the complementary surface on CaM. Protein kinase C phosphorylation of eNOS T495, adjacent to the CaM-binding site, abolishes or greatly slows CaM binding. Kinases which increase the activity of eNOS did not stimulate the binding of CaM, which is already diffusion limited. The coupling of Ca(2+) binding and CaM/NOS binding equilibria links the affinity of CaM for NOS to the Ca(2+) dependence of CaM binding. Hence, changes in the Ca(2+) sensitivity of CaM binding always imply changes in the NOS-CaM affinity. It is possible, however, that in some regimes binding and activation are not synonymous, so that Ca(2+) sensitivity need not be tightly linked to CaM sensitivity of activation. This study is being extended using mutants to probe the roles of individual structural elements in binding and release.},

abstract = {Some 40 years ago it was recognized by Furchgott and colleagues that the endothelium releases a vasodilator, endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). Later on, several groups identified EDRF to be a gas, nitric oxide (NO). Since then, NO was identified as one of the most versatile and unique molecules in animal and human biology. Nitric oxide mediates a plethora of physiological functions, for example, maintenance of vascular tone and inflammation. Apart from these physiological functions, NO is also involved in the pathophysiology of various disorders, specifically those in which regulation of blood flow and inflammation has a key role. The aim of the current review is to summarize the role of NO in cerebral ischemia, the most common cause of stroke.},

abstract = {Endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is the predominant enzyme responsible for vascular NO synthesis. A functional eNOS transfers electrons from NADPH to its heme center, where L-arginine is oxidized to L-citrulline and NO. Common conditions predisposing to atherosclerosis, such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus and smoking, are associated with enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduced amounts of bioactive NO in the vessel wall. NADPH oxidases represent major sources of ROS in cardiovascular pathophysiology. NADPH oxidase-derived superoxide avidly interacts with eNOS-derived NO to form peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)), which oxidizes the essential NOS cofactor (6R-)5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)). As a consequence, oxygen reduction uncouples from NO synthesis, thereby rendering NOS to a superoxide-producing pro-atherosclerotic enzyme. Supplementation with BH(4) corrects eNOS dysfunction in several animal models and in patients. Administration of high local doses of the antioxidant L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) improves endothelial function, whereas large-scale clinical trials do not support a strong role for oral vitamin C and/or E in reducing cardiovascular disease. Statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1 receptor blockers have the potential of reducing vascular oxidative stress. Finally, novel approaches are being tested to block pathways leading to oxidative stress (e.g. protein kinase C) or to upregulate antioxidant enzymes.},

@article{Corson1996a,
abstract = {Endothelial cells release nitric oxide (NO) more potently in response to increased shear stress than to agonists which elevate intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). To determine mechanistic differences in the regulation of endothelial constitutive NO synthase (ecNOS), we measured NO production by bovine aortic endothelial cells exposed to shear stress in a laminar flow chamber or treated with Ca2+ ionophores in static culture. The kinetics of cumulative NO production varied strikingly: shear stress (25 dyne/cm2) stimulated a biphasic increase over control that was 13-fold at 60 minutes, whereas raising [Ca2+]i caused a monophasic 6-fold increase. We hypothesized that activation of a protein kinase cascade mediates the early phase of flow-dependent NO production. Immunoprecipitation of ecNOS showed a 210\% increase in phosphorylation 1 minute after flow initiation, whereas there was no significant increase after Ca2+ ionophore treatment. Although ecNOS was not tyrosine-phosphorylated, the early phase of flow-dependent NO production was blocked by genistein, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases. To determine the Ca2+ requirement for flow-dependent NO production, we measured [Ca2+]i with a novel flow-step protocol. [Ca2+]i increased with the onset of shear stress, but not after a step increase. However, the step increase in shear stress was associated with a potent biphasic increase in NO production rate and ecNOS phosphorylation. These studies demonstrate that shear stress can increase NO production in the absence of increased [Ca2+]i, and they suggest that phosphorylation of ecNOS may importantly modulate its activity during the imposition of increased shear stress.},

abstract = {The link between atherosclerosis and regions of disturbed flow and low wall shear stress is now firmly established, but the causal mechanisms underlying the link are not yet understood. It is now recognised that the endothelium is not simply a passive barrier between the blood and the vessel wall, but plays an active role in maintaining vascular homeostasis and participates in the onset of atherosclerosis. Calcium signalling is one of the principal intracellular signalling mechanisms by which endothelial cells (EC) respond to external stimuli, such as fluid shear stress and ligand binding. Previous studies have separately modelled mass transport of chemical species in the bloodstream and calcium dynamics in EC via the inositol trisphosphate (IP(3)) signalling pathway. We review existing models of these two phenomena, before going on to integrate the two components to provide an inclusive new model for the calcium response of the endothelium in an arbitrary vessel geometry. This enables the combined effects of fluid flow and biochemical stimulation on EC to be investigated and is the first time spatially varying, physiological fluid flow-related environmental factors have been combined with intracellular signalling in a mathematical model. Model results show that low endothelial calcium levels in the area of disturbed flow at an arterial widening may be one contributing factor to the onset of vascular disease.},

abstract = {In the past two decades, over 1000 clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a benefit in treating stroke, with the exception of thrombolytics. Although many targets have been pursued, including antioxidants, calcium channel blockers, glutamate receptor blockers, and neurotrophic factors, often the focus has been on neuronal mechanisms of injury. Broader attention to loss and dysfunction of non-neuronal cell types is now required to increase the chance of success. Of the several glial cell types, this review will focus on astrocytes. Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the higher mammalian nervous system, and they play key roles in normal CNS physiology and in central nervous system injury and pathology. In the setting of ischemia astrocytes perform multiple functions, some beneficial and some potentially detrimental, making them excellent candidates as therapeutic targets to improve outcome following stroke and in other central nervous system injuries. The older neurocentric view of the central nervous system has changed radically with the growing understanding of the many essential functions of astrocytes. These include K+ buffering, glutamate clearance, brain antioxidant defense, close metabolic coupling with neurons, and modulation of neuronal excitability. In this review, we will focus on those functions of astrocytes that can both protect and endanger neurons, and discuss how manipulating these functions provides a novel and important strategy to enhance neuronal survival and improve outcome following cerebral ischemia.},

abstract = {Moment-to-moment changes in local neuronal activity lead to dynamic changes in cerebral blood flow. Emerging evidence implicates astrocytes as one of the key players in coordinating this neurovascular coupling. Astrocytes are poised to sense glutamatergic synaptic activity over a large spatial domain via activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors and subsequent calcium signaling and via energy-dependent glutamate transport. Astrocyte foot processes can signal vascular smooth muscle by arachidonic acid pathways involving astrocytic cytochrome P450 epoxygenase, astrocytic cyclooxygenase-1 and smooth muscle cytochrome P450 omega-hydroxylase activities, and by astrocytic and smooth muscle potassium channels. Non-glutamatergic transmitters released from neurons, such as nitric oxide, cyclooxygenase-2 metabolites and vasoactive intestinal peptide, might modulate neurovascular signaling at the level of the astrocyte or smooth muscle. Thus, astrocytes have a pivotal role in dynamic signaling within the neurovascular unit. Important questions remain on how this signaling is integrated with other pathways in health and disease.},

In the clinic, unequivocal electrophysiological evidence now exists that spreading depolarizations occur abundantly in individuals with aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage, delayed ischemic stroke after subarachnoid hemorrhage, malignant hemispheric stroke, spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage or traumatic brain injury. Spreading depolarization is induced experimentally by various noxious conditions including chemicals such as potassium, glutamate, inhibitors of the sodium pump, status epilepticus, hypoxia, hypoglycemia and ischemia, but it can can also invade healthy, naive tissue. Resistance vessels respond to it with tone alterations, causing either transient hyperperfusion (physiological hemodynamic response) in healthy tissue or severe hypoperfusion (inverse hemodynamic response, or spreading ischemia) in tissue at risk for progressive damage, which contributes to lesion progression. Therapies that target spreading depolarization or the inverse hemodynamic response may potentially treat these neurological conditions.},

abstract = {Astroglia from the postnatal cerebral cortex can be reprogrammed in vitro to generate neurons following forced expression of neurogenic transcription factors, thus opening new avenues towards a potential use of endogenous astroglia for brain repair. However, in previous attempts astroglia-derived neurons failed to establish functional synapses, a severe limitation towards functional neurogenesis. It remained therefore also unknown whether neurons derived from reprogrammed astroglia could be directed towards distinct neuronal subtype identities by selective expression of distinct neurogenic fate determinants. Here we show that strong and persistent expression of neurogenic fate determinants driven by silencing-resistant retroviral vectors instructs astroglia from the postnatal cortex in vitro to mature into fully functional, synapse-forming neurons. Importantly, the neurotransmitter fate choice of astroglia-derived neurons can be controlled by selective expression of distinct neurogenic transcription factors: forced expression of the dorsal telencephalic fate determinant neurogenin-2 (Neurog2) directs cortical astroglia to generate synapse-forming glutamatergic neurons; in contrast, the ventral telencephalic fate determinant Dlx2 induces a GABAergic identity, although the overall efficiency of Dlx2-mediated neuronal reprogramming is much lower compared to Neurog2, suggesting that cortical astroglia possess a higher competence to respond to the dorsal telencephalic fate determinant. Interestingly, however, reprogramming of astroglia towards the generation of GABAergic neurons was greatly facilitated when the astroglial cells were first expanded as neurosphere cells prior to transduction with Dlx2. Importantly, this approach of expansion under neurosphere conditions and subsequent reprogramming with distinct neurogenic transcription factors can also be extended to reactive astroglia isolated from the adult injured cerebral cortex, allowing for the selective generation of glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. These data provide evidence that cortical astroglia can undergo a conversion across cell lineages by forced expression of a single neurogenic transcription factor, stably generating fully differentiated neurons. Moreover, neuronal reprogramming of astroglia is not restricted to postnatal stages but can also be achieved from terminally differentiated astroglia of the adult cerebral cortex following injury-induced reactivation.},

abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a diffusion barrier, which impedes influx of most compounds from blood to brain. Three cellular elements of the brain microvasculature compose the BBB-endothelial cells, astrocyte end-feet, and pericytes (PCs). Tight junctions (TJs), present between the cerebral endothelial cells, form a diffusion barrier, which selectively excludes most blood-borne substances from entering the brain. Astrocytic end-feet tightly ensheath the vessel wall and appear to be critical for the induction and maintenance of the TJ barrier, but astrocytes are not believed to have a barrier function in the mammalian brain. Dysfunction of the BBB, for example, impairment of the TJ seal, complicates a number of neurologic diseases including stroke and neuroinflammatory disorders. We review here the recent developments in our understanding of the BBB and the role of the BBB dysfunction in CNS disease. We have focused on intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in premature infants, which may involve dysfunction of the TJ seal as well as immaturity of the BBB in the germinal matrix (GM). A paucity of TJs or PCs, coupled with incomplete coverage of blood vessels by astrocyte end-feet, may account for the fragility of blood vessels in the GM of premature infants. Finally, this review describes the pathogenesis of increased BBB permeability in hypoxia-ischemia and inflammatory mechanisms involving the BBB in septic encephalopathy, HIV-induced dementia, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer disease.},

abstract = {The tight spatial and temporal coupling between neuronal activity and blood flow ensures that active brain regions receive an adequate supply of oxygen and energetic metabolites. There clearly is still an enormous amount of experimental and theoretical work to be done to unravel the precise mechanism of neurovascular coupling, but over the last decade significant advances have been made. The most recent studies confirm the original finding that the activation of Ca(2+) elevations in astrocyte endfeet is an essential step but also reveal new levels of complexity in the astrocyte control of neurovascular coupling. The recent evidence for a link between Ca(2+) signalling in astrocytes and local metabolic states of the brain tissue has broad implications for the interpretation of data from functional brain imaging studies. Unraveling the full molecular mechanism of the astrocyte control of cerebral blood flow represents a formidable challenge in neurobiological research in the years to come that might also create opportunities for the development of new therapeutic strategies for cerebrovascular diseases such as ischemic stroke, hypertension and migraine as well as neurodegenerative diseases as Alzheimer's disease.},

The exact role of pericytes in the neurovascular unit in the adult brain and during brain aging remains, however, elusive. Using adult viable pericyte-deficient mice, we show that pericyte loss leads to brain vascular damage by two parallel pathways: (1) reduction in brain microcirculation causing diminished brain capillary perfusion, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral blood flow responses to brain activation that ultimately mediates chronic perfusion stress and hypoxia, and (2) blood-brain barrier breakdown associated with brain accumulation of serum proteins and several vasculotoxic and/or neurotoxic macromolecules ultimately leading to secondary neuronal degenerative changes. We show that age-dependent vascular damage in pericyte-deficient mice precedes neuronal degenerative changes, learning and memory impairment, and the neuroinflammatory response. Thus, pericytes control key neurovascular functions that are necessary for proper neuronal structure and function, and pericyte loss results in a progressive age-dependent vascular-mediated neurodegeneration.},

Knowledge of how these cells control blood flow is crucial for understanding how neural computation is powered, for interpreting functional imaging scans of brains, and for developing treatments for neurological disorders. It is now recognized that neurotransmitter-mediated signalling has a key role in regulating cerebral blood flow, that much of this control is mediated by astrocytes, that oxygen modulates blood flow regulation, and that blood flow may be controlled by capillaries as well as by arterioles. These conceptual shifts in our understanding of cerebral blood flow control have important implications for the development of new therapeutic approaches.},

abstract = {A numerical model of neurovascular coupling (NVC) is presented based on neuronal activity coupled to vasodilation/contraction models via the astrocytic mediated perivascular K(+) and the smooth muscle cell Ca(2+) pathway. Luminal agonists acting on P2Y receptors on the endothelial cell surface provide a flux of IP3 into the endothelial cytosol. This concentration of IP3 is transported via gap junctions between endothelial and smooth muscle cells providing a source of sacroplasmic derived Ca(2+) in the smooth muscle cell. The model is able to relate a neuronal input signal to the corresponding vessel reaction. Results indicate that blood flow mediated IP3 production via the agonist ATP has a substantial effect on the contraction/dilation dynamics of the SMC. The resulting variation in cytosolic Ca(2+) can enhance and inhibit the flow of blood to the cortical tissue. IP3 coupling between endothelial and smooth muscle cells seems to be important in the dynamics of the smooth muscle cell. The VOCC channels are, due to the hyperpolarisation from K(+) SMC efflux, almost entirely closed and do not seem to play a significant role during neuronal activity. The current model shows that astrocytic Ca(2+) is not necessary for neurovascular coupling to occur in contrast to a number of experiments outlining the importance of astrocytic Ca(2+) in NVC, however this Ca(2+) pathway is not the only one mediating NVC. Importantly agonists in flowing blood have a significant influence on the endothelial and smooth muscle cell dynamics.},

abstract = {Functional neuroimaging relies on the robust coupling between neuronal activity, metabolism and cerebral blood flow (CBF), but the physiological basis of the neuroimaging signals is still poorly understood. We examined the mechanisms of activity-dependent changes in tissue oxygenation in relation to variations in CBF responses and postsynaptic activity in rat cerebellar cortex. To increase synaptic activity we stimulated the monosynaptic, glutamatergic climbing fibres that excite Purkinje cells via AMPA receptors. We used local field potentials to indicate synaptic activity, and recorded tissue oxygen partial pressure (P(tiss,O2)) by polarographic microelectrodes, and CBF using laser-Doppler flowmetry. The disappearance rate of oxygen in the tissue increased linearly with synaptic activity. This indicated that, without a threshold, oxygen consumption increased as a linear function of synaptic activity. The reduction in P(tiss,O2) preceded the rise in CBF. The time integral (area) of the negative P(tiss,O2) response increased non-linearly showing saturation at high levels of synaptic activity, concomitant with a steep rise in CBF. This was accompanied by a positive change in P(tiss,O2). Neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibition enhanced the initial negative P(tiss,O2) response ('dip'), while attenuating the evoked CBF increase and positive P(tiss,O2) response equally. This indicates that increases in CBF counteract activity-induced reductions in P(tiss,O2), and suggests the presence of a tissue oxygen reserve. The changes in P(tiss,O2) and CBF were strongly attenuated by AMPA receptor blockade. Our findings suggest an inverse relationship between negative P(tiss,O2) and CBF responses, and provide direct in vivo evidence for a tight coupling between activity in postsynaptic AMPA receptors and cerebellar oxygen consumption.},

abstract = {beta-Amyloid protein (A beta) is the major component of the senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and microglial cells have been shown to be closely associated with these plaques. However, the roles of A beta and microglial cells in pathogenesis of AD remain unclear. Incubation of rat microglial cells with A beta(1-40) caused a significant increase in nitrite, a stable metabolite of nitric oxide (NO), in culture media, while there was no detectable increase in nitrite in astrocyte-rich glial cells or cortical neurons after incubation with A beta(1-40). Nitrite production by microglial cells was also induced by A beta(1-42), but not A beta(25-35). An inhibitor of NO synthase, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA), as well as dexamethasone and actinomycin D, dose-dependently inhibited this nitrite production. Among the various cytokines investigated such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), only IFN-gamma markedly enhanced A beta-dependent nitrite production. Cultured cortical neurons were injured by microglial cells stimulated with A beta in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of IFN-gamma. Neurotoxicity caused by the A beta plus IFN-gamma-stimulated microglial cells was significantly attenuated by NMMA. Thus, although further investigations into the effect of A beta on human microglial cells are needed, it is likely that A beta-induced NO production by microglial cells is one mechanism of the neuronal death in AD.},

The patients were evaluated by the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR0-CDR3) and studied in the Memory and Aging Project (MAP) of the Washington University Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADCR). With the use of immunocytochemical procedures, neurons immunoreactive to nNOS were found to show large and small multipolar and pyramidal morphologies over the entire chronic AD evolution.

abstract = {Historically, the neuron has been the conceptual focus for almost all of neuroscience research. In recent years, however, the concept of the neurovascular unit has emerged as a new paradigm for investigating both physiology and pathology in the CNS. This concept proposes that a purely neurocentric focus is not sufficient, and emphasizes that all cell types in the brain including neuronal, glial and vascular components, must be examined in an integrated context. Cell-cell signaling and coupling between these different compartments form the basis for normal function. Disordered signaling and perturbed coupling form the basis for dysfunction and disease. In this mini-review, we will survey four examples of this phenomenon: hemodynamic neurovascular coupling linking blood flow to brain activity; cellular communications that evoke the blood-brain barrier phenotype; parallel systems that underlie both neurogenesis and angiogenesis in the CNS; and finally, the potential exchange of trophic factors that may link neuronal, glial and vascular homeostasis.},

@article{Farr2011,
abstract = {Functional hyperemia is an important metabolic autoregulation mechanism by which increased neuronal activity is matched by a rapid and regional increase in blood supply. This mechanism is facilitated by a process known as "neurovascular coupling"--the orchestrated communication system involving neurons, astrocytes and arterioles. Important steps in this process are the production of EETs in the astrocyte and the release of potassium, via two potassium channels (BK and KIR), into the perivascular space. We provide a model which successfully accounts for several observations seen in experiment. The model is capable of simulating the approximate 15\% arteriolar dilation caused by a 60-s neuronal activation (modelled as a release of potassium and glutamate into the synaptic cleft). This model also successfully emulates the paradoxical experimental finding that vasoconstriction follows vasodilation when the astrocytic calcium concentration (or perivascular potassium concentration) is increased further. We suggest that the interaction of the changing smooth muscle cell membrane potential and the changing potassium-dependent resting potential of the KIR channel are responsible for this effect. Finally, we demonstrate that a well-controlled mechanism of potassium buffering is potentially important for successful neurovascular coupling.},

@article{Rivadulla2011,
abstract = {Spontaneous contraction and relaxation of arteries (and in some instances venules) has been termed vasomotion and has been observed in an extensive variety of tissues and species. However, its functions and underlying mechanisms are still under discussion. We demonstrate that in vivo spectrophotometry, measured simultaneously with extracellular recordings at the same locations in the visual thalamus of the cat, reveals vasomotion, measured as an oscillation (0.14 hz) in the recorded oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) signal, which appears spontaneously in the microcirculation and can last for periods of hours. During some non-oscillatory periods, maintained sensory stimulation evokes vasomotion lasting \~{}30s, resembling an adaptive vascular phenomenon. This oscillation in the oxyhaemoblobin signal is sensitive to pharmacological manipulation: it is inducible by chloralose anaesthesia and it can be temporarily blocked by systemic administration of adrenaline or acetylcholine (ACh). During these oscillatory periods, neurovascular coupling (i.e. the relationship between local neural activity and the rate of blood supply to that location) appears significantly altered. This raises important questions with regard to the interpretation of results from studies currently dependent upon a linear relationship between neural activity and blood flow, such as neuroimaging.},

abstract = {The question of the preferred substrate of glutamatergic neurons at high neural activity has been vibrantly debated for over a decade since the classical hypothesis (CH) of the primacy of glucose has been challenged by the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis (ANLSH), which replaces the primacy of glucose with astrocyte produced lactate. We perform Bayesian Flux Balance Analysis (BFBA) with a new mathematical model of cellular brain energetics, comprising detailed biochemical pathways in and between astrocytes and glutamatergic neurons and partitioning of each cell type into cytosol and mitochondria. Supported by the results of our in silico studies, which are in remarkable agreement with previously published results, we posit the Glucose Shunt Hypothesis (GSH) that during high activity, the inhibition of the phosphofructokinase (PFK) enzyme in neuron impairs neuronal glycolysis, enabling the process by which lactate effluxed by astrocytes is taken up by glutamatergic neurons, whereas at low activity, glucose remains the preferred substrate for neurons. We postulate that the ANLS is a shunt utilized by glutamatergic neurons to bypass their glycolysis impaired by the inhibition of PFK in connection with increased oxidative phosphorylation at high neuronal activity.},

@article{Dormanns2014a,
abstract = {A numerical model of neurovascular coupling (NVC) is presented based on neuronal activity coupled to vasodilation/contraction models via the astrocytic mediated perivascular K(+) and the smooth muscle cell Ca(2+) pathway. Luminal agonists acting on P2Y receptors on the endothelial cell surface provide a flux of IP3 into the endothelial cytosol. This concentration of IP3 is transported via gap junctions between endothelial and smooth muscle cells providing a source of sacroplasmic derived Ca(2+) in the smooth muscle cell. The model is able to relate a neuronal input signal to the corresponding vessel reaction. Results indicate that blood flow mediated IP3 production via the agonist ATP has a substantial effect on the contraction/dilation dynamics of the SMC. The resulting variation in cytosolic Ca(2+) can enhance and inhibit the flow of blood to the cortical tissue. IP3 coupling between endothelial and smooth muscle cells seems to be important in the dynamics of the smooth muscle cell. The VOCC channels are, due to the hyperpolarisation from K(+) SMC efflux, almost entirely closed and do not seem to play a significant role during neuronal activity. The current model shows that astrocytic Ca(2+) is not necessary for neurovascular coupling to occur in contrast to a number of experiments outlining the importance of astrocytic Ca(2+) in NVC, however this Ca(2+) pathway is not the only one mediating NVC. Importantly agonists in flowing blood have a significant influence on the endothelial and smooth muscle cell dynamics.},

abstract = {We used two-photon (2-p) F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy to provide serial, noninvasive measurements of [Ca(2+)] in arterioles of living "biosensor" mice. These express a genetically encoded Ca(2+) indicator (GECI), either FRET-based exMLCK or intensity-based GCaMP2. The FRET ratios, Rmin and Rmax, required for in vivo Ca(2+) calibration of exMLCK were obtained in isolated arteries. For in vivo experiments, mice were anesthetized (1.5\% isoflurane), and arterioles within a depilated ear were visualized through the intact skin (i.e., noninvasively), by 2-p excitation of exMLCK (at 820 nm) or GCaMP2 (at 920 nm). Spontaneous or agonist-evoked [Ca(2+)] transients in arteriolar smooth muscle cells were imaged (at 2 Hz) with both exMLCK and GCaMP2. To examine changes in arteriolar [Ca(2+)] that might accompany hypertension, five exMLCK mice were implanted with telemetric blood pressure transducers and osmotic minipumps containing ANG II (350 ng·kg(-1)·min(-1)) and fed a high (6\%)-salt diet for 9 days. [Ca(2+)] was measured every other day in five smooth muscle cells of two to three arterioles in each animal. Prior to ANG II/salt, [Ca(2+)] was 246 ± 42 nM. [Ca(2+)] increased transiently to 599 nM on day 2 after beginning ANG II/salt, then remained elevated at 331 ± 42 nM for 4 more days, before returning to 265 ± 47 nM 6 days after removal of ANG II/salt. In summary, two-photon excitation of exMLCK and GCaMP2 provides a method for noninvasive, longitudinal quantification of [Ca(2+)] dynamics and vascular structure in individual arterioles of a particular animal over an extended period of time, a capability that should enhance future studies of hypertension and vascular function.},

The present study investigated the effects of a single bilateral i.c.v. infusion of pre-aggregated A$\beta$(25-35) (30 nmol/rat) on animals' performance in the open field, and on arginine metabolic enzymes and metabolites in the CA1, CA2/3, and dentate gyrus (DG) sub-regions of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) at the time point of 6-8 days after A$\beta$ infusion. A$\beta$(25-35) rats displayed reduced exploratory activity in the open field relative to the A$\beta$(35-25) (reverse peptide; 30 nmol) rats. A$\beta$(25-35) resulted in significantly decreased nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and endothelial NOS protein expression, but increased arginase activity, arginase II protein expression, and ornithine and putrescine levels, in hippocampal CA2/3. There were increased glutamate and putrescine levels in the DG, but decreased agmatine levels in the DG and PFC, in the A$\beta$(25-35) group relative to the A$\beta$(35-25) one. Cluster analyses were performed to determine if the nine related neurochemical variables (arginine, citrulline, ornithine, agmatine, putrescine, spermidine, spemine, glutamate, and GABA) formed distinct groups, and whether it changed as a function of A$\beta$(25-35). There were substantially different clusters between the two groups in the hippocampus and PFC. These results demonstrate that A$\beta$(25-35) alters arginine metabolism, which further supports the prominent role of arginine and its metabolites in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis.},

This coupling is specific enough in space and time that modern imaging methods use local hemodynamics as a measure of brain activity. In this review, we discuss recent evidence indicating that neuronal activity is coupled to local blood flow changes through an intermediary, the astrocyte. We highlight unresolved issues regarding the role of astrocytes and propose ways to address them using novel techniques. Our focus is on cellular level analysis in vivo, but we also relate mechanistic insights gained from ex vivo experiments to native tissue. We also review some strategies to harness advances in optical and genetic methods to study neurovascular coupling in the intact brain.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is a relative newcomer to pharmacology, as the paper which initiated the field was published only 25 years ago. Nevertheless its impact is such that to date more than 31,000 papers have been published with NO in the title and more than 65,000 refer to it in some way. The identification of NO with endothelium-derived relaxing factor and the discovery of its synthesis from L-arginine led to the realisation that the L-arginine: NO pathway is widespread and plays a variety of physiological roles. These include the maintenance of vascular tone, neurotransmitter function in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, and mediation of cellular defence. In addition, NO interacts with mitochondrial systems to regulate cell respiration and to augment the generation of reactive oxygen species, thus triggering mechanisms of cell survival or death. This review will focus on the role of NO in the cardiovascular system where, in addition to maintaining a vasodilator tone, it inhibits platelet aggregation and adhesion and modulates smooth muscle cell proliferation. NO has been implicated in a number of cardiovascular diseases and virtually every risk factor for these appears to be associated with a reduction in endothelial generation of NO. Reduced basal NO synthesis or action leads to vasoconstriction, elevated blood pressure and thrombus formation. By contrast, overproduction of NO leads to vasodilatation, hypotension, vascular leakage, and disruption of cell metabolism. Appropriate pharmacological or molecular biological manipulation of the generation of NO will doubtless prove beneficial in such conditions.},

abstract = {The term cerebral small vessel disease refers to a group of pathological processes with various aetiologies that affect the small arteries, arterioles, venules, and capillaries of the brain. Age-related and hypertension-related small vessel diseases and cerebral amyloid angiopathy are the most common forms. The consequences of small vessel disease on the brain parenchyma are mainly lesions located in the subcortical structures such as lacunar infarcts, white matter lesions, large haemorrhages, and microbleeds. Because lacunar infarcts and white matter lesions are easily detected by neuroimaging, whereas small vessels are not, the term small vessel disease is frequently used to describe the parenchyma lesions rather than the underlying small vessel alterations. This classification, however, restricts the definition of small vessel disease to ischaemic lesions and might be misleading. Small vessel disease has an important role in cerebrovascular disease and is a leading cause of cognitive decline and functional loss in the elderly. Small vessel disease should be a main target for preventive and treatment strategies, but all types of presentation and complications should be taken into account.},

Here, I propose the neurovascular hypothesis of AD, suggesting that faulty clearance of amyloid beta peptide (A beta) across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), aberrant angiogenesis and senescence of the cerebrovascular system could initiate neurovascular uncoupling, vessel regression, brain hypoperfusion and neurovascular inflammation. Ultimately, this would lead to BBB compromise, to chemical imbalance in the neuronal environment and to synaptic and neuronal dysfunction, injury and loss. Based on the neurovascular hypothesis, I suggest an array of new potential therapeutic approaches that could be developed for AD, to enhance A beta clearance and neurovascular repair, and to protect the neurovascular unit from divergent inducers of injury and apoptosis.},

abstract = {Abstract Nitric oxide (NO) has emerged as a key mediator in the mechanisms of ischaemic tolerance induced by a wide variety of preconditioning stimuli. NO is involved in the brain protection that develops either early (minutes-hours) or late (days-weeks) after the preconditioning stimulus. However, the sources of NO and the mechanisms underlying the protective effects differ substantially. While in early preconditioning NO is produced by the endothelial and neuronal isoform of NO synthase, in delayed preconditioning NO is synthesized by the inducible or 'immunological' isoform of NO synthase. Furthermore, in early preconditioning, NO acts through the canonical cGMP pathway, possibly through protein kinase G and opening of mitochondrial K(ATP) channels. In late preconditioning, the protection is mediated by peroxynitrite formed by the reaction of NO with superoxide derived from the enzyme NADPH oxidase. The mechanisms by which peroxynitrite exerts its protective effect may include improvement of post-ischaemic cerebrovascular function, leading to enhancement of blood flow to the ischaemic territory, and expression of prosurvival genes resulting in cytoprotection. The evidence suggests that NO can engage highly effective and multifunctional prosurvival pathways, which could be exploited for the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular pathologies.},

abstract = {Many experimental studies have shown that arterial smooth muscle cells respond with cytosolic calcium rises to vasoconstrictor stimulation. A low vasoconstrictor concentration gives rise to asynchronous spikes in the calcium concentration in a few cells (asynchronous flashing). With a greater vasoconstrictor concentration, the number of smooth muscle cells responding in this way increases (recruitment) and calcium oscillations may appear. These oscillations may eventually synchronize and generate arterial contraction and vasomotion. We show that these phenomena of recruitment and synchronization naturally emerge from a model of a population of smooth muscle cells coupled through their gap junctions. The effects of electrical, calcium, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate coupling are studied. A weak calcium coupling is crucial to obtain a synchronization of calcium oscillations and the minimal required calcium permeability is deduced. Moreover, we note that an electrical coupling can generate oscillations, but also has a desynchronizing effect.

@article{Lindauer2010,
abstract = {Recently, a universal, simple, and fail-safe mechanism has been proposed by which cerebral blood flow (CBF) might be coupled to oxygen metabolism during neuronal activation without the need for any tissue-based mechanism. According to this concept, vasodilation occurs by local erythrocytic release of nitric oxide or ATP wherever and whenever hemoglobin is deoxygenated, directly matching oxygen demand and supply in every tissue. For neurovascular coupling in the brain, we present experimental evidence challenging this view by applying an experimental regime operating without deoxy-hemoglobin. Hyperbaric hyperoxygenation (HBO) allowed us to prevent hemoglobin deoxygenation, as the oxygen that was physically dissolved in the tissue was sufficient to support oxidative metabolism. Regional CBF and regional cerebral blood oxygenation were measured using a cranial window preparation in anesthetized rats. Hemodynamic and neuronal responses to electrical forepaw stimulation or cortical spreading depression (CSD) were analyzed under normobaric normoxia and during HBO up to 4 ATA (standard atmospheres absolute). Inconsistent with the proposed mechanism, during HBO, CBF responses to functional activation or CSD were unchanged. Our results show that activation-induced CBF regulation in the brain does not operate through the release of vasoactive mediators on hemoglobin deoxygenation or through a tissue-based oxygen-sensing mechanism.},

abstract = {Smooth muscle and endothelial cells in the arterial wall are exposed
to mechanical stress. Indeed blood flow induces intraluminal pressure
variations and shear stress. An increase in pressure may induce a
vessel contraction, a phenomenon known as the myogenic response.
Many muscular vessels present vasomotion, i.e., rhythmic diameter
oscillations caused by synchronous cytosolic calcium oscillations
of the smooth muscle cells. Vasomotion has been shown to be modulated
by pressure changes. To get a better understanding of the effect
of stress and in particular pressure on vasomotion, we propose a
model of a blood vessel describing the calcium dynamics in a coupled
population of smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells and the consequent
vessel diameter variations. We show that a rise in pressure increases
the calcium concentration. This may either induce or abolish vasomotion,
or increase its frequency depending on the initial conditions. In
our model the myogenic response is less pronounced for large arteries
than for small arteries and occurs at higher values of pressure if
the wall thickness is increased. Our results are in agreement with
experimental observations concerning a broad range of vessels.},

abstract = {Because regional blood flow increases in association with the increased metabolic demand generated by localized increases in neural activity, functional imaging researchers often assume that changes in blood flow are an accurate read-out of changes in underlying neural activity. An understanding of the mechanisms that link changes in neural activity to changes in blood flow is crucial for assessing the validity of this assumption, and for understanding the processes that can go wrong during disease states such as ischaemic stroke. Many studies have investigated the mechanisms of neurovascular regulation in arterioles but other evidence suggests that blood flow regulation can also occur in capillaries, because of the presence of contractile cells, pericytes, on the capillary wall. Here we review the evidence that pericytes can modulate capillary diameter in response to neuronal activity and assess the likely importance of neurovascular regulation at the capillary level for functional imaging experiments. We also discuss evidence suggesting that pericytes are particularly sensitive to damage during pathological insults such as ischaemia, Alzheimer's disease and diabetic retinopathy, and consider the potential impact that pericyte dysfunction might have on the development of therapeutic interventions and on the interpretation of functional imaging data in these disorders.},

abstract = {Functional hyperemia is an important metabolic autoregulation mechanism by which increased neuronal activity is matched by a rapid and regional increase in blood supply. This mechanism is facilitated by a process known as "neurovascular coupling"--the orchestrated communication system involving neurons, astrocytes and arterioles. Important steps in this process are the production of EETs in the astrocyte and the release of potassium, via two potassium channels (BK and KIR), into the perivascular space. We provide a model which successfully accounts for several observations seen in experiment. The model is capable of simulating the approximate 15\% arteriolar dilation caused by a 60-s neuronal activation (modelled as a release of potassium and glutamate into the synaptic cleft). This model also successfully emulates the paradoxical experimental finding that vasoconstriction follows vasodilation when the astrocytic calcium concentration (or perivascular potassium concentration) is increased further. We suggest that the interaction of the changing smooth muscle cell membrane potential and the changing potassium-dependent resting potential of the KIR channel are responsible for this effect. Finally, we demonstrate that a well-controlled mechanism of potassium buffering is potentially important for successful neurovascular coupling.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is believed to be involved in a variety of central nervous system (CNS) functions, including opioid responsivity. Elucidation of the role of NO in the CNS requires the ability to elevate systematically neuronal NO concentrations in vivo. This study was conducted to assess the pharmacokinetics of L-arginine, a NO precursor, and to relate the disposition of this amino acid to the pharmacodynamic endpoint of neuronal NO production. L-Arginine (250-, 500-, or 1000-mg/kg/h) or saline was infused intravenously for 6 h to rats. L-Arginine was quantified in brain and blood (after in vivo microdialysis) with high-performance liquid chromatography. NO was quantified simultaneously with a sensitive and specific amperometric sensor placed in the hippocampus. The data were fit with a comprehensive pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model to obtain parameters governing the systemic disposition of L-arginine, the uptake of L-arginine into the brain, and subsequent NO production. Exogenous administration of L-arginine resulted in incremental elevations in hippocampal NO, with a ∼33, 48, and ∼50\% increase from control for the 250-, 500-, and 1000-mg/kg/h L-arginine treated rats, respectively. The PK/PD model, which incorporated known characteristics of the system (saturable uptake of L-arginine into brain; NO production governed by circadian changes in enzyme activity) was capable of describing accurately the observed data. The model developed herein will be invaluable in characterizing the numerous roles of NO in the CNS. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The effects of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) on the function of cerebral blood vessels were analyzed applying cerebral blood volume (CBV)-based fMRI to transgenic arcA beta mice. In a cortical brain region of interest (ROI), displaying high CAA, arcA beta mice older than 16 months showed reduced response to the vasodilatory substance acetazolamide compared to age-matched wild-type animals, both with regard to rate (vascular reactivity) and extent of vasodilation (maximal vasodilation). In a subcortical ROI, displaying little CAA, no genotype-specific decrease was observed, but maximal vasodilation decreased with age in arcA beta and wild-types. These findings indicate that vascular beta-amyloid deposits reduce the capacity of cerebral blood vessels to dilate upon demand, supporting the hypothesis that vascular beta-amyloid contributes to hypoperfusion and neurological deficits observed in AD and CAA. High diagnostic accuracy of the combined readouts in detecting vascular dysfunction in arcA beta mice was found.},

abstract = {Shear stress stimulates nitric oxide (NO) production by phosphorylating endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) at Ser(1179) in a phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)- and protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent manner. The eNOS has additional potential phosphorylation sites, including Ser(116), Thr(497), and Ser(635). Here, we studied these potential phosphorylation sites in response to shear, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and 8-bromocAMP (8-BRcAMP) in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). All three stimuli induced phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser(635), which was consistently slower than that at Ser(1179). Thr(497) was rapidly dephosphorylated by 8-BRcAMP but not by shear and VEGF. None of the stimuli phosphorylated Ser(116). Whereas shear-stimulated Ser(635) phosphorylation was not affected by phosphoinositide-3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY-294002, it was blocked by either treating the cells with a PKA inhibitor H89 or infecting them with a recombinant adenovirus-expressing PKA inhibitor. These results suggest that shear stress stimulates eNOS by two different mechanisms: 1) PKA- and PI3K-dependent and 2) PKA-dependent but PI3K-independent pathways. Phosphorylation of Ser(635) may play an important role in chronic regulation of eNOS in response to mechanical and humoral stimuli.},

abstract = {An important issue in synaptic physiology is the extent to which postsynaptic receptors are saturated by the neurotransmitter released from a single synaptic vesicle. Although the bulk of evidence supports receptor saturation, recent studies have started to reveal that alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors may not be saturated by a single vesicle of glutamate. Here, we address this question through a study of putative single synapses, made by hippocampal neurons in culture, that are identified by FM1-43 staining. An analysis of the sources of variability in the amplitudes of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents at single synapses reveals that this variability must arise presynaptically, from variations in the quantity of agonist released. Thus, glutamate receptors at hippocampal synapses are not generally saturated by quantal release.},

It is designed to introduce cell biology and neuroscience students to computational modeling, and applied mathematics students, theoretical biologists, and engineers to many of the problems in dynamical cell biology. This volume was conceived of and begun by Professor Joel Keizer based on his many years of teaching and research together with his colleagues. The project was expanded and finished by his students and friends after his untimely death in 1999. Carefully selected examples are used to motivate the concepts and techniques of computational cell biology, through a progression of increasingly more complex and demanding cases. Illustrative exercises are included with every chapter, and mathematical and computational appendices are provided for reference. This textbook will be useful for advanced undergraduate and graduate theoretical biologists, and for mathematics students and life scientists who wish to learn about modeling in cell biology.

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule that is widely used in the nervous system. With recognition of its roles in synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation, LTP; long-term depression, LTD) and elucidation of calcium-dependent, NMDAR-mediated activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), numerous molecular and pharmacological tools have been used to explore the physiology and pathological consequences for nitrergic signaling. In this review, the authors summarize the current understanding of this subtle signaling pathway, discuss the evidence for nitrergic modulation of ion channels and homeostatic modulation of intrinsic excitability, and speculate about the pathological consequences of spillover between different nitrergic compartments in contributing to aberrant signaling in neurodegenerative disorders. Accumulating evidence points to various ion channels and particularly voltage-gated potassium channels as signaling targets, whereby NO mediates activity-dependent control of intrinsic neuronal excitability; such changes could underlie broader mechanisms of synaptic plasticity across neuronal networks. In addition, the inability to constrain NO diffusion suggests that spillover from endothelium (eNOS) and/or immune compartments (iNOS) into the nervous system provides potential pathological sources of NO and where control failure in these other systems could have broader neurological implications. Abnormal NO signaling could therefore contribute to a variety of neurodegenerative pathologies such as stroke/excitotoxicity, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease.},

abstract = {The oxygen exchange and correlation between the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) in the cortical capillary levels for normal and pathologic brain functions remain the subject of debate. A 3D realistic mesoscale model of the cortical capillary network (non-tree like) is constructed using a random Voronoi tessellation in which each edge represents a capillary segment. The hemodynamics and oxygen transport are numerically simulated in the model, which involves rheological laws in the capillaries, oxygen diffusion, and non-linear binding of oxygen to hemoglobin, respectively. The findings show that the cerebral hypoxia due to a significant decreased perfusion (as can occur in stroke) can be avoided by a moderate reduction in oxygen demand. Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) can be an important indicator for the brain oxygen metabolism under normal perfusion and misery-perfusion syndrome (leading to ischemia). The results demonstrated that a disproportionately large increase in blood supply is required for a small increase in the oxygen demand, which, in turn, is strongly dependent on the resting OEF. The predicted flow-metabolism coupling in the model supports the experimental studies of spatiotemporal stimulations in humans by positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging.},

@article{Peers2009,
abstract = {Periods of chronic hypoxia, which can arise from numerous cardiorespiratory disorders, predispose individuals to the development of dementias, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is characterized in part by the increased production of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), which forms the extracellular plaques by which the disease can be identified post mortem. Numerous studies have now shown that hypoxia, even in vitro, can increase production of Abeta in different cell types. Evidence has been produced to indicate hypoxia alters both expression of the Abeta precursor, APP, and also the expression of the secretase enzymes, which cleave Abeta from APP. Other studies implicate reduced Abeta degradation as a possible means by which hypoxia increases Abeta levels. Such variability may be attributable to cell-specific responses to hypoxia. Further evidence indicates that some, but not all of the cellular adaptations to chronic hypoxia (including alteration of Ca(2+) homeostasis) require Abeta formation. However, other aspects of hypoxic remodeling of cell function appear to occur independently of this process. The molecular and cellular responses to hypoxia contribute to our understanding of the clinical association of hypoxia and increased incidence of AD. However, it remains to be determined whether inhibition of one or more of the effects of hypoxia may be of benefit in arresting the development of this neurodegenerative disease.},

@article{Grubina2007,
abstract = {Recent studies reveal a novel role for hemoglobin as an allosterically regulated nitrite reductase that may mediate nitric oxide (NO)-dependent signaling along the physiological oxygen gradient. Nitrite reacts with deoxyhemoglobin in an allosteric reaction that generates NO and oxidizes deoxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin. NO then reacts at a nearly diffusion-limited rate with deoxyhemoglobin to form iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin, which to date has been considered a highly stable adduct and, thus, not a source of bioavailable NO. However, under physiological conditions of partial oxygen saturation, nitrite will also react with oxyhemoglobin, and although this complex autocatalytic reaction has been studied for a century, the interaction of the oxy- and deoxy-reactions and the effects on NO disposition have never been explored. We have now characterized the kinetics of hemoglobin oxidation and NO generation at a range of oxygen partial pressures and found that the deoxy-reaction runs in parallel with and partially inhibits the oxy-reaction. In fact, intermediates in the oxy-reaction oxidize the heme iron of iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin, a product of the deoxy-reaction, which releases NO from the iron-nitrosyl. This oxidative denitrosylation is particularly striking during cycles of hemoglobin deoxygenation and oxygenation in the presence of nitrite. These chemistries may contribute to the oxygen-dependent disposition of nitrite in red cells by limiting oxidative inactivation of nitrite by oxyhemoglobin, promoting nitrite reduction to NO by deoxyhemoglobin, and releasing free NO from iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin.},

abstract = {Pericytes play a key role in the development of cerebral microcirculation. The exact role of pericytes in the neurovascular unit in the adult brain and during brain aging remains, however, elusive. Using adult viable pericyte-deficient mice, we show that pericyte loss leads to brain vascular damage by two parallel pathways: (1) reduction in brain microcirculation causing diminished brain capillary perfusion, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral blood flow responses to brain activation that ultimately mediates chronic perfusion stress and hypoxia, and (2) blood-brain barrier breakdown associated with brain accumulation of serum proteins and several vasculotoxic and/or neurotoxic macromolecules ultimately leading to secondary neuronal degenerative changes. We show that age-dependent vascular damage in pericyte-deficient mice precedes neuronal degenerative changes, learning and memory impairment, and the neuroinflammatory response. Thus, pericytes control key neurovascular functions that are necessary for proper neuronal structure and function, and pericyte loss results in a progressive age-dependent vascular-mediated neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays critical roles in the maintenance of central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis. Dysfunction of the BBB occurs in a number of CNS diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). A prevailing hypothesis in the AD field is the amyloid cascade hypothesis that states that amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) deposition in the CNS initiates a cascade of molecular events that cause neurodegeneration, leading to AD onset and progression. In this review, the participation of the BBB in the amyloid cascade and in other mechanisms of AD neurodegeneration will be discussed. We will specifically focus on three aspects of BBB dysfunction: disruption, perturbation of transporters, and secretion of neurotoxic substances by the BBB. We will also discuss the interaction of the BBB with components of the neurovascular unit in relation to AD and the potential contribution of AD risk factors to aspects of BBB dysfunction. From the results discussed herein, we conclude that BBB dysfunction contributes to AD through a number of mechanisms that could be initiated in the presence or absence of A$\beta$ pathology.},

branches and bifurcations. The focus of the present study is understanding
how pulsatile flow effects mass transfer, observing both mean and
transient variations. Unlike in the many idealized models which model
transport of low diffusion coefficient species, the realistic geometry
leads to very different mass transfer characteristics. These include
spiral patterns in the distribution of low concentration fluid. Furthermore,
the mean ATP distribution was found to be elevated compared with
the steady state; this is attributed to the effects of convective
mixing. The results strongly implicate that under certain conditions
mass transport in pulsatile flow exhibits different hydrolysis characteristics
at the endothelium compared with steady state. Transient variations
throughout the the cardiac cycle were found to be small. This small
transient response is primarily due to low ATP diffusivity.},

abstract = {We developed a new technique to estimate the aortic pressure (AP) waveform from a single peripheral artery pressure (PAP) waveform. The technique 1) employs a parallel tube model of the arterial tree to establish a transfer function relating PAP to AP with unknown parameters; 2) estimates the parameters from the measured PAP waveform, along with a single non-invasive measurement of the wave transmission delay from the aorta to the peripheral artery measurement site, by exploiting the fact that aortic flow is zero during diastole; and 3) applies the transfer function to the PAP waveform to predict the unmeasured AP waveform. In this way, in contrast to the conventional generalized transfer function paradigm, the transfer function is able to adapt to the inter-subject and temporal variability of the arterial tree. We applied this adaptive transfer function technique to PAP waveforms measured from five dogs instrumented with reference AP catheters during various hemodynamic interventions. Our results showed that the technique was able to reliably estimate the AP waveform with an overall error of 4.2 mmHg. For comparison, the corresponding errors of two previously proposed generalized transfer functions trained on a subset of the same canine data were, on average, 19\% larger.},

abstract = {A cell culture model of blood-brain barrier (BBB, coculture of rat brain endothelial cells with rat astrocytes) was used to investigate the effect of nitric oxide (.NO) on the damage of the BBB induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). Permeability coefficient of fluorescein across the endothelium was used as a marker of BBB tightness. The permeability coefficient increased 5.2 times after H/R indicating strong disruption of the BBB. The presence of the .NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP, 30 microM), authentic .NO (6 microM) or superoxide dismutase (50 units/ml) during H/R attenuated H/R-induced increase in permeability. 30 microM SNAP or 6 microM .NO did not influence the function of BBB during normoxia, however, severe disruption was observed using 150 microM of SNAP and more than 24 microM of .NO. After H/R of endothelial cells, the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) increased 2.3 times indicating radical-induced peroxidation of membrane lipids. 30 microM SNAP or 6 microM authentic .NO completely prevented MDA formation. The results show that .NO may effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species formed during H/R of brain capillary endothelial cells, affording protection of BBB at the molecular and functional level.},

@article{Silver1996,
abstract = {1. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded under whole-cell voltage clamp from granule cells in slices of rat cerebellum. EPSCs from individual mossy fibre inputs were identified by their all-or-none appearance in response to a graded stimulus. Excitatory synaptic transmission was investigated at room temperature (approximately 24 degrees C) and at near-physiological temperature (approximately 34 degrees C) by analysing current fluctuations in the peak and decay of the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (non-NMDA) component of EPSCs. 2. In a subset of synapses the mean EPSC amplitude remained unchanged as the probability of transmitter release was substantially lowered by raising the extracellular Mg2+ and lowering Ca2+. These synapses were considered to have only one functional release site. Single-site synapses had small EPSCs (139 16 pS, n = 5, at 24 degrees C) with a large coefficient of variation (c.v. = 0.23 0.02, n = 5) and an amplitude distribution that was well fitted by a Gaussian distribution in four out of five cases. The EPSC latency had a unimodal distribution and its standard deviation had a temperature dependence with a temperature coefficient (Q10; range, 24-35 degrees C) of 2.4 0.4 (n = 4). 3. Peak-scaled non-stationary fluctuation analysis of single-site EPSCs indicated that the mean conductance of the underlying non-NMDA channels was 12 2 pS (n = 4) at 35 degrees C. Upper and lower limits for mean channel open probability (Po), calculated from fluctuations in the EPSC peak amplitude, were 0.51 and 0.38, respectively. These estimates, together with the open probability of the channel when bound by transmitter, suggest that only about 50\% of the non-NMDA channels were occupied following the release of a quantum of transmitter. 4. At some multi-site synapses EPSCs had a low c.v. (0.4 0.01, n = 5) at 34 degrees C and non-stationary fluctuation analysis gave a parabolic variance-mean current relationship. This suggests that practically all of the non-NMDA receptors were occupied by glutamate at the peak of EPSC. The channel open probability (Po = 0.84 0.03, n = 5) at these 'saturated' multi-site synapses will therefore equal the open probability of the channel when bound by transmitter (Po,max). 5. Non-stationary fluctuation analysis of EPSCs from 'saturating' multi-site synapses indicated that 170 40 postsynaptic non-NMDA channels were exposed to transmitter at the peak of the EPSC. The mean conductance of the synaptic channels was 10 2 pS (n = 5) at 34 degrees C. 6. At synapses with multiple release sites the EPSC decay time became faster when release probability was lowered (by reducing the external Ca2+/Mg2+ ratio), indicating that the transmitter concentration profile depended on release probability. No such speeding of the EPSC decay was observed at single-site synapses. 7. Our results suggest that release of a packet of transmitter from a single release site does not saturate postsynaptic non-NMDA receptors at cerebellar mossy fibre-granule cell synapses. However, at multi-site synapses transmitter released from neighbouring sites can overlap, changing the transmitter concentration profile in the synaptic cleft. We conclude that the level of postsynaptic receptor occupancy can depend on the probability of transmitter release at individual multi-site synapses.},

abstract = {Astrocytes were the original neuroglia of Ram\'{o}n y Cajal but after 100 years there is no satisfactory definition of what should comprise this class of cells. This essay takes a historical and philosophical approach to the question of astrocytic identity. The classic approach of identification by morphology and location are too limited to determine new members of the astrocyte population. I also critically evaluate the use of protein markers measured by immunoreactivity, as well as the newer technique of marking living cells by using promoters for these same proteins to drive reporter genes. These two latter approaches have yielded an expanded population of astrocytes with diverse functions, but also mark cells that traditionally would not be defined as astrocytes. Thus we need a combination of measures to define an astrocyte but it is not clear what this combination should be. The molecular approach, especially promoter driven fluorescent reporter genes, does have the advantage of pre marking living astrocytes for electrophysiological or imaging recordings. However, lack of sufficient understanding of the behavior of the inserted constructs has led to unclear results. This approach will no doubt be perfected with time but at present an acceptable, practical definition of what constitutes the class of astrocytes remains elusive.},

abstract = {A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach was presented to model the blood flows in the carotid bifurcation and the brain arteries under altered gravity. Physical models required for CFD simulation were introduced including a model for arterial wall motion due to fluid-wall interactions, a shear thinning fluid model of blood, a vascular bed model for outflow boundary conditions, and a model for autoregulation mechanism. The three-dimensional unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled with these models were solved iteratively using the pseudocompressibility method and dual time stepping. Gravity source terms were added to the Navier-Stokes equations to take the effect of gravity into account. For the treatment of complex geometry, a chimera overset grid technique was adopted to obtain connectivity between arterial branches. For code validation, computed results were compared with experimental data for both steady-state and time-dependent flows. This computational approach was then applied to blood flows through a realistic carotid bifurcation and two Circle of Willis models, one using an idealized geometry and the other using an anatomical data set. A three-dimensional Circle of Willis configuration was reconstructed from subject-specific magnetic resonance images using an image segmentation method. Through the numerical simulation of blood flow in two model problems, namely, the carotid bifurcation and the brain arteries, it was observed that the altered gravity has considerable effects on arterial contraction/dilatation and consequent changes in flow conditions.},

abstract = {Neuronal activity evokes localized changes in blood flow. Although this response, termed neurovascular coupling, is widely used to monitor human brain function and diagnose pathology, the cellular mechanisms that mediate the response remain unclear. We investigated the contribution of glial cells to neurovascular coupling in the acutely isolated mammalian retina. We found that light stimulation and glial cell stimulation can both evoke dilation or constriction of arterioles. Light-evoked and glial-evoked vasodilations were blocked by inhibitors of cytochrome P450 epoxygenase, the synthetic enzyme for epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. Vasoconstrictions, in contrast, were blocked by an inhibitor of omega-hydroxylase, which synthesizes 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Nitric oxide influenced whether vasodilations or vasoconstrictions were produced in response to light and glial stimulation. Light-evoked vasoactivity was blocked when neuron-to-glia signaling was interrupted by a purinergic antagonist. These results indicate that glial cells contribute to neurovascular coupling and suggest that regulation of blood flow may involve both vasodilating and vasoconstricting components.},

abstract = {Understanding the link between neuronal responses (NRs) and metabolic signals is fundamental to our knowledge of brain function and it is a milestone in our efforts to interpret data from modern non invasive optical techniques such as fMRI, which are based on the close coupling between metabolic demand of active neurons and local changes in blood flow. The challenge is to unravel the link. Here we show, using spectrophotometry to record oxyhaemoglobin and methemoglobin (surrogate markers of cerebral flow and nitric oxide levels respectively) together with extracellular neuronal recordings in vivo and applying a multiple polynomial regression model, that the markers are able to predict up about 80\% of variability in NR. Furthermore, we show that the coupling between blood flow and neuronal activity is heavily influenced by nitric oxide (NO). While NRs show the typical saturating response, blood flow shows a linear behaviour during contrast-response curves, with nitric oxide from different sources acting differently for low and high intensity.},

Accumulating evidence suggests the implication of altered arginine metabolism in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study systematically compared the metabolic profile of L-arginine in the superior frontal gyrus, hippocampus, and cerebellum from AD (mean age 80years) and normal (mean age 80 or 60years) cases. The activity and protein expression of nitric oxide synthase and arginase were altered with AD and age in a region-specific manner. There were also AD- and age-related changes in the tissue concentrations of L-arginine and its downstream metabolites (L-citrulline, L-ornithine, agmatine, putrescine, spermidine, spermine, glutamate, $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid, and glutamine) in a metabolite- or region-specific manner. These findings demonstrate that arginine metabolism is dramatically altered in diverse regions of AD brains, thus meriting further investigation to understand its role in the pathogenesis and/or progression of the disease. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Thrombin has been found in neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Also, traumatic brain injury, where neurons are exposed to high thrombin levels, is associated with an increased incidence of AD. Our objective was to determine the effects of thrombin administered in vivo on cognitive function and neuropathology. Rats were trained using a radial eight-arm maze and then thrombin (25 or 100 nM, 0.25 microl/h, 28 days) or vehicle was delivered via intracerebroventricular infusion. Animals that received 100 nM thrombin demonstrated cognitive impairments including deficits in reference memory and an increase in task latency. Also, significant neuropathology was detected in these animals such as enlargement of cerebral ventricles, an increased number of TUNEL-positive cells, astrogliosis, and an increase in the immunoreactivity for phosphorylated neurofilament, and apolipoprotein-E fragments. Thrombin-induced changes in cognitive function and ventricular enlargement were inhibited by hirudin. These findings demonstrate that thrombin is a mediator of neurotoxicity and cognitive deficits and suggest that inhibition of thrombin may be a treatment strategy for AD- or head trauma-associated cognitive deficits.},

abstract = {The level of [InsP3]cyt required for calcium release in A7r5 cells, a smooth muscle cell line, was determined by a new set of procedures using quantitative confocal microscopy to measure release of InsP3 from cells microinjected with caged InsP3. From these experiments, the [InsP3]cyt required to evoke a half-maximal calcium response is 100 nM. Experiments with caged glycerophosphoryl-myo-inositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (GPIP2), a slowly metabolized analogue of InsP3, gave a much slower recovery and a half-maximal response of an order of magnitude greater than InsP3. Experimental data and highly constrained variables were used to construct a mathematical model of the InsP3-dependent [Ca2+]cyt changes; the resulting simulations show high fidelity to experiment. Among the elements considered in constructing this model were the mechanism of the InsP3-receptor, InsP3 degradation, calcium buffering in the cytosol, and refilling of the ER stores via sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA) pumps. The model predicts a time constant of 0.8 s for InsP3 degradation and 13 s for GPIP2. InsP3 degradation was found to be a prerequisite for [Ca2+]cyt recovery to baseline levels and is therefore critical to the pattern of the overall [Ca2+]cyt signal. Analysis of the features of this model provides insights into the individual factors controlling the amplitude and shape of the InsP3-mediated calcium signal.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are still the most frequent cause of death in Western Europe. Pathophysiological experiments revealed in the last years that the vascular endothelium, as well as a result of the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), is a crucial regulator of vascular function and homeostasis. The vascular endothelium plays a key role in cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology, largely via NO-dependent processes. L-Arginine is the substrate for the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) to generate NO. Endothelial dysfunction is caused by various cardiovascular risk factors. In most studies, acute and chronic administration of L-arginine has been shown to improve endothelial function in animal models of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Therefore, numerous studies have been conducted to elucidate whether dietary L-arginine supplementation can augment NO production in humans and thereby improve endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. The most likely mechanism that explains the occurrence of endothelial dysfunction and the effect of L-arginine is that application of L-arginine antagonizes asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), the endogenous NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor. This could solve the L-arginine paradox namely that L-arginine improves NO-mediated vascular function in vivo, although its baseline plasma concentration is about 25- to 30-fold higher than the Michaelis-Menten constant Km of the isolated, purified eNOS in vitro. Recent findings suggest that large, prospective, randomized clinical trials might be needed to identify those patients who are the most likely to benefit from L-arginine. Testing patients for ADMA and L-arginine plasma levels for calculating the L-arginine/ADMA ratio might be an adequate strategy.},

abstract = {Vascular dysfunction has a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent data from brain imaging studies in humans and animal models suggest that cerebrovascular dysfunction may precede cognitive decline and onset of neurodegenerative changes in AD and AD models. Cerebral hypoperfusion and impaired amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) clearance across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may contribute to the onset and progression of dementia AD type. Decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) negatively affects the synthesis of proteins required for memory and learning, and may eventually lead to neuritic injury and neuronal death. Impaired clearance of Abeta from the brain by the cells of the neurovascular unit may lead to its accumulation on blood vessels and in brain parenchyma. The accumulation of Abeta on the cerebral blood vessels, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is associated with cognitive decline and is one of the hallmarks of AD pathology. CAA can severely disrupt the integrity of the blood vessel wall resulting in micro or macro intracerebral bleedings that exacerbates neurodegenerative process and inflammatory response and may lead to hemorrhagic stroke, respectively. Here, we review the role of the neurovascular unit and molecular mechanisms in vascular cells behind AD and CAA pathogenesis. First, we discuss apparent vascular changes, including the cerebral hypoperfusion and vascular degeneration that contribute to different stages of the disease process in AD individuals. We next discuss the role of the low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP), a key Abeta clearance receptor at the BBB and along the cerebrovascular system, whose expression is suppressed early in AD. We also discuss how brain-derived apolipoprotein E isoforms may influence Abeta clearance across the BBB. We then review the role of two interacting transcription factors, myocardin and serum response factor, in cerebral vascular cells in controlling CBF responses and LRP-mediated Abeta clearance. Finally, we discuss the role of microglia and perivascular macrophages in Abeta clearance from the brain. The data reviewed here support an essential role of neurovascular and BBB mechanisms in contributing to both, onset and progression of AD.},

abstract = {Many experimental studies have shown that arterial smooth muscle cells respond with cytosolic calcium rises to vasoconstrictor stimulation. A low vasoconstrictor concentration gives rise to asynchronous spikes in the calcium concentration in a few cells (asynchronous flashing). With a greater vasoconstrictor concentration, the number of smooth muscle cells responding in this way increases (recruitment) and calcium oscillations may appear. These oscillations may eventually synchronize and generate arterial contraction and vasomotion. We show that these phenomena of recruitment and synchronization naturally emerge from a model of a population of smooth muscle cells coupled through their gap junctions. The effects of electrical, calcium, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate coupling are studied. A weak calcium coupling is crucial to obtain a synchronization of calcium oscillations and the minimal required calcium permeability is deduced. Moreover, we note that an electrical coupling can generate oscillations, but also has a desynchronizing effect. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate diffusion does not play an important role to achieve synchronization. Our model is validated by published in vitro experiments obtained on rat mesenteric arterial segments.},

abstract = {Deposition of beta-amyloid along cerebral vessels is found in most patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease. The effects of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) on the function of cerebral blood vessels were analyzed applying cerebral blood volume (CBV)-based fMRI to transgenic arcA beta mice. In a cortical brain region of interest (ROI), displaying high CAA, arcA beta mice older than 16 months showed reduced response to the vasodilatory substance acetazolamide compared to age-matched wild-type animals, both with regard to rate (vascular reactivity) and extent of vasodilation (maximal vasodilation). In a subcortical ROI, displaying little CAA, no genotype-specific decrease was observed, but maximal vasodilation decreased with age in arcA beta and wild-types. These findings indicate that vascular beta-amyloid deposits reduce the capacity of cerebral blood vessels to dilate upon demand, supporting the hypothesis that vascular beta-amyloid contributes to hypoperfusion and neurological deficits observed in AD and CAA. High diagnostic accuracy of the combined readouts in detecting vascular dysfunction in arcA beta mice was found.},

This coupling is specific enough in space and time that modern imaging methods use local hemodynamics as a measure of brain activity. In this review, we discuss recent evidence indicating that neuronal activity is coupled to local blood flow changes through an intermediary, the astrocyte. We highlight unresolved issues regarding the role of astrocytes and propose ways to address them using novel techniques. Our focus is on cellular level analysis in vivo, but we also relate mechanistic insights gained from ex vivo experiments to native tissue. We also review some strategies to harness advances in optical and genetic methods to study neurovascular coupling in the intact brain.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is a relative newcomer to pharmacology, as the paper which initiated the field was published only 25 years ago. Nevertheless its impact is such that to date more than 31,000 papers have been published with NO in the title and more than 65,000 refer to it in some way. The identification of NO with endothelium-derived relaxing factor and the discovery of its synthesis from L-arginine led to the realisation that the L-arginine: NO pathway is widespread and plays a variety of physiological roles. These include the maintenance of vascular tone, neurotransmitter function in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, and mediation of cellular defence. In addition, NO interacts with mitochondrial systems to regulate cell respiration and to augment the generation of reactive oxygen species, thus triggering mechanisms of cell survival or death. This review will focus on the role of NO in the cardiovascular system where, in addition to maintaining a vasodilator tone, it inhibits platelet aggregation and adhesion and modulates smooth muscle cell proliferation. NO has been implicated in a number of cardiovascular diseases and virtually every risk factor for these appears to be associated with a reduction in endothelial generation of NO. Reduced basal NO synthesis or action leads to vasoconstriction, elevated blood pressure and thrombus formation. By contrast, overproduction of NO leads to vasodilatation, hypotension, vascular leakage, and disruption of cell metabolism. Appropriate pharmacological or molecular biological manipulation of the generation of NO will doubtless prove beneficial in such conditions.},

@article{Hyder2006,
abstract = {Prior 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) experiments, which simultaneously measured in vivo rates of total glutamate-glutamine cycling (V(cyc(tot))) and neuronal glucose oxidation (CMR(glc(ox), N)), revealed a linear relationship between these fluxes above isoelectricity, with a slope of approximately 1. In vitro glial culture studies examining glutamate uptake indicated that glutamate, which is cotransported with Na+, stimulated glial uptake of glucose and release of lactate. These in vivo and in vitro results were consolidated into a model: recycling of one molecule of neurotransmitter between glia and neurons was associated with oxidation of one glucose molecule in neurons; however, the glucose was taken up only by glia and all the lactate (pyruvate) generated by glial glycolysis was transferred to neurons for oxidation. The model was consistent with the 1:1 relationship between DeltaCMR(glc(ox), N) and DeltaV(cyc(tot)) measured by 13C MRS. However, the model could not specify the energetics of glia and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) neurons because quantitative values for these pathways were not available. Here, we review recent 13C and 14C tracer studies that enable us to include these fluxes in a more comprehensive model. The revised model shows that glia produce at least 8\% of total oxidative ATP and GABAergic neurons generate approximately 18\% of total oxidative ATP in neurons. Neurons produce at least 88\% of total oxidative ATP, and take up approximately 26\% of the total glucose oxidized. Glial lactate (pyruvate) still makes the major contribution to neuronal oxidation, but approximately 30\% less than predicted by the prior model. The relationship observed between DeltaCMR(glc(ox), N) and DeltaV(cyc(tot)) is determined by glial glycolytic ATP as before. Quantitative aspects of the model, which can be tested by experimentation, are discussed.},

abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a diffusion barrier, which impedes influx of most compounds from blood to brain. Three cellular elements of the brain microvasculature compose the BBB-endothelial cells, astrocyte end-feet, and pericytes (PCs). Tight junctions (TJs), present between the cerebral endothelial cells, form a diffusion barrier, which selectively excludes most blood-borne substances from entering the brain. Astrocytic end-feet tightly ensheath the vessel wall and appear to be critical for the induction and maintenance of the TJ barrier, but astrocytes are not believed to have a barrier function in the mammalian brain. Dysfunction of the BBB, for example, impairment of the TJ seal, complicates a number of neurologic diseases including stroke and neuroinflammatory disorders. We review here the recent developments in our understanding of the BBB and the role of the BBB dysfunction in CNS disease. We have focused on intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in premature infants, which may involve dysfunction of the TJ seal as well as immaturity of the BBB in the germinal matrix (GM). A paucity of TJs or PCs, coupled with incomplete coverage of blood vessels by astrocyte end-feet, may account for the fragility of blood vessels in the GM of premature infants. Finally, this review describes the pathogenesis of increased BBB permeability in hypoxia-ischemia and inflammatory mechanisms involving the BBB in septic encephalopathy, HIV-induced dementia, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer disease.},

abstract = {Spontaneous contraction and relaxation of arteries (and in some instances venules) has been termed vasomotion and has been observed in an extensive variety of tissues and species. However, its functions and underlying mechanisms are still under discussion. We demonstrate that in vivo spectrophotometry, measured simultaneously with extracellular recordings at the same locations in the visual thalamus of the cat, reveals vasomotion, measured as an oscillation (0.14 hz) in the recorded oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) signal, which appears spontaneously in the microcirculation and can last for periods of hours. During some non-oscillatory periods, maintained sensory stimulation evokes vasomotion lasting \~{}30s, resembling an adaptive vascular phenomenon. This oscillation in the oxyhaemoblobin signal is sensitive to pharmacological manipulation: it is inducible by chloralose anaesthesia and it can be temporarily blocked by systemic administration of adrenaline or acetylcholine (ACh). During these oscillatory periods, neurovascular coupling (i.e. the relationship between local neural activity and the rate of blood supply to that location) appears significantly altered. This raises important questions with regard to the interpretation of results from studies currently dependent upon a linear relationship between neural activity and blood flow, such as neuroimaging.},

abstract = {Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a slow-moving ionic and metabolic disturbance that propagates in cortical brain tissue. In addition to massive cellular depolarizations, CSD also involves significant changes in perfusion and metabolism-aspects of CSD that had not been modeled and are important to traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and migraine. In this study, we develop a mathematical model for CSD where we focus on modeling the features essential to understanding the implications of neurovascular coupling during CSD. In our model, the sodium-potassium-ATPase, mainly responsible for ionic homeostasis and active during CSD, operates at a rate that is dependent on the supply of oxygen. The supply of oxygen is determined by modeling blood flow through a lumped vascular tree with an effective local vessel radius that is controlled by the extracellular potassium concentration. We show that during CSD, the metabolic demands of the cortex exceed the physiological limits placed on oxygen delivery, regardless of vascular constriction or dilation. However, vasoconstriction and vasodilation play important roles in the propagation of CSD and its recovery. Our model replicates the qualitative and quantitative behavior of CSD--vasoconstriction, oxygen depletion, extracellular potassium elevation, prolonged depolarization--found in experimental studies. We predict faster, longer duration CSD in vivo than in vitro due to the contribution of the vasculature. Our results also help explain some of the variability of CSD between species and even within the same animal. These results have clinical and translational implications, as they allow for more precise in vitro, in vivo, and in silico exploration of a phenomenon broadly relevant to neurological disease.},

abstract = {Historically, the neuron has been the conceptual focus for almost all of neuroscience research. In recent years, however, the concept of the neurovascular unit has emerged as a new paradigm for investigating both physiology and pathology in the CNS. This concept proposes that a purely neurocentric focus is not sufficient, and emphasizes that all cell types in the brain including neuronal, glial and vascular components, must be examined in an integrated context. Cell-cell signaling and coupling between these different compartments form the basis for normal function. Disordered signaling and perturbed coupling form the basis for dysfunction and disease. In this mini-review, we will survey four examples of this phenomenon: hemodynamic neurovascular coupling linking blood flow to brain activity; cellular communications that evoke the blood-brain barrier phenotype; parallel systems that underlie both neurogenesis and angiogenesis in the CNS; and finally, the potential exchange of trophic factors that may link neuronal, glial and vascular homeostasis.},

abstract = {Vascular cells communicate electrically to coordinate their activity and control tissue blood flow. To foster a quantitative understanding of this fundamental process, we developed a computational model that was structured to mimic a skeletal muscle resistance artery. Each endothelial cell and smooth muscle cell in our virtual artery was treated as the electrical equivalent of a capacitor coupled in parallel with a non-linear resistor representing ionic conductance; intercellular gap junctions were represented by ohmic resistors. Simulations revealed that the vessel wall is not a syncytium in which electrical stimuli spread equally to all constitutive cells. Indeed, electrical signals spread in a differential manner among and between endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells according to the initial stimulus. The predictions of our model agree with physiological data from the feed artery of the hamster retractor muscle. Cell orientation and coupling resistance were the principal factors that enable electrical signals to spread differentially along and between the two cell types. Our computational observations also illustrated how gap junctional coupling enables the vessel wall to filter and transform transient electrical events into sustained voltage responses. Functionally, differential electrical communication would permit discrete regions of smooth muscle activity to locally regulate blood flow and the endothelium to coordinate regional changes in tissue perfusion.},

abstract = {Calcium signaling in C6 glioma cells in culture was examined with digital fluorescence video microscopy. C6 cells express low levels of the gap junction protein connexin43 and have correspondingly weak gap junctional communication as evidenced by dye coupling (Naus, C. C. G., J. F. Bechberger, S. Caveney, and J. X. Wilson. 1991. Neurosci. Lett. 126:33-36). Transfection of C6 cells with the cDNA encoding connexin43 resulted in clones with increased expression of connexin43 mRNA and protein and increased dye coupling, as well as markedly reduced rates of proliferation (Zhu, D., S. Caveney, G. M. Kidder, and C. C. Naus. 1991. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 88:1883-1887; Naus, C. C. G., D. Zhu, S. Todd, and G. M. Kidder. 1992. Cell Mol. Neurobiol. 12:163-175). Mechanical stimulation of a single cell in a culture of non-transfected C6 cells induced a wave of increased intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) that showed little or no communication to adjacent cells. By contrast, mechanical stimulation of a single cell in cultures of C6 clones expressing transfected connexin43 cDNA induced a Ca2+ wave that was communicated to multiple surrounding cells, and the extent of communication was proportional to the level of expression of the connexin43 cDNA. These results provide direct evidence that intercellular Ca2+ signaling occurs via gap junctions. Ca2+ signaling through gap junctions may provide a means for the coordinated regulation of cellular function, including cell growth and differentiation.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is a relative newcomer to pharmacology, as the paper which initiated the field was published only 25 years ago. Nevertheless its impact is such that to date more than 31,000 papers have been published with NO in the title and more than 65,000 refer to it in some way. The identification of NO with endothelium-derived relaxing factor and the discovery of its synthesis from L-arginine led to the realisation that the L-arginine: NO pathway is widespread and plays a variety of physiological roles. These include the maintenance of vascular tone, neurotransmitter function in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, and mediation of cellular defence. In addition, NO interacts with mitochondrial systems to regulate cell respiration and to augment the generation of reactive oxygen species, thus triggering mechanisms of cell survival or death. This review will focus on the role of NO in the cardiovascular system where, in addition to maintaining a vasodilator tone, it inhibits platelet aggregation and adhesion and modulates smooth muscle cell proliferation. NO has been implicated in a number of cardiovascular diseases and virtually every risk factor for these appears to be associated with a reduction in endothelial generation of NO. Reduced basal NO synthesis or action leads to vasoconstriction, elevated blood pressure and thrombus formation. By contrast, overproduction of NO leads to vasodilatation, hypotension, vascular leakage, and disruption of cell metabolism. Appropriate pharmacological or molecular biological manipulation of the generation of NO will doubtless prove beneficial in such conditions.},

abstract = {It is well-known that cyclic variations of the vascular diameter, a phenomenon called vasomotion, are induced by synchronous calcium oscillations of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). However, the role of the endothelium on vasomotion is unclear. Some experimental studies claim that the endothelium is necessary for synchronization and vasomotion, whereas others report rhythmic contractions in the absence of an intact endothelium. Moreover, endothelium-derived factors have been shown to abolish vasomotion by desynchronizing the calcium signals in SMCs. By modeling the calcium dynamics of a population of SMCs coupled to a population of endothelial cells, we analyze the effects of an SMC vasoconstrictor stimulation on endothelial cells and the feedback of endothelium-derived factors. Our results show that the endothelium essentially decreases the SMCs calcium level and may move the SMCs from a steady state to an oscillatory domain, and vice versa. In the oscillatory domain, a population of coupled SMCs exhibits synchronous calcium oscillations. Outside the oscillatory domain, the coupled SMCs present only irregular calcium flashings arising from noise modeling stochastic opening of channels. Our findings provide explanations for the published contradictory experimental observations.},

Although many targets have been pursued, including antioxidants, calcium channel blockers, glutamate receptor blockers, and neurotrophic factors, often the focus has been on neuronal mechanisms of injury. Broader attention to loss and dysfunction of non-neuronal cell types is now required to increase the chance of success. Of the several glial cell types, this review will focus on astrocytes. Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the higher mammalian nervous system, and they play key roles in normal CNS physiology and in central nervous system injury and pathology. In the setting of ischemia astrocytes perform multiple functions, some beneficial and some potentially detrimental, making them excellent candidates as therapeutic targets to improve outcome following stroke and in other central nervous system injuries. The older neurocentric view of the central nervous system has changed radically with the growing understanding of the many essential functions of astrocytes. These include K+ buffering, glutamate clearance, brain antioxidant defense, close metabolic coupling with neurons, and modulation of neuronal excitability. In this review, we will focus on those functions of astrocytes that can both protect and endanger neurons, and discuss how manipulating these functions provides a novel and important strategy to enhance neuronal survival and improve outcome following cerebral ischemia.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanism of brain glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier is of importance to understanding brain energy metabolism. The specific kinetics of glucose transport have been generally described using standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics. These models predict that the steady-state glucose concentration approaches an upper limit in the human brain when the plasma glucose level is well above the Michaelis-Menten constant for half-maximal transport, Kt. In experiments where steady-state plasma glucose content was varied from 4 to 30 mM, the brain glucose level was a linear function of plasma glucose concentration. At plasma concentrations nearing 30 mM, the brain glucose level approached 9 mM, which was significantly higher than predicted from the previously reported Kt of approximately 4 mM (p < 0.05). The high brain glucose concentration measured in the human brain suggests that ablumenal brain glucose may compete with lumenal glucose for transport. We developed a model based on a reversible Michaelis-Menten kinetic formulation of unidirectional transport rates. Fitting this model to brain glucose level as a function of plasma glucose level gave a substantially lower Kt of 0.6 +/- 2.0 mM, which was consistent with the previously reported millimolar Km of GLUT-1 in erythrocyte model systems. Previously reported and reanalyzed quantification provided consistent kinetic parameters. We conclude that cerebral glucose transport is most consistently described when using reversible Michaelis-Menten kinetics.},

abstract = {While a range of cellular mechanisms have been proposed to underlie control of neurovascular coupling, a comprehensive, reconciliatory model has yet to be determined. To fit with such a model, it is essential that candidate mechanisms exhibit reaction times, spatial ranges, and speeds of propagation that are consistent with the vascular manifestations of the 'hemodynamic response'. Understanding these vascular dynamics is therefore a critical step towards developing a robust model of neurovascular coupling. In this study, we utilize high-speed optical imaging of exposed rodent somatosensory cortex to explore and characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface vessels during functional hyperemia. Our high-speed, high-resolution optical imaging approach allows us to study the hemodynamic response independently in individual vessels, and in discrete regions of the parenchyma with enough resolution to precisely characterize subtle spatial and temporal features of the response. Specifically, we explore when and where the first hemodynamic changes occur in response to stimuli, the direction and speed at which these changes propagate in arterioles and regions of the parenchyma, and the relative timing at which each of these compartments returns to its original baseline state. From these results, we are able to conclude that the hemodynamic response appears to initiate in the parenchyma and then spreads rapidly to surface arterioles. Following the initial onset we find evidence that the response spreads spatially outwards via the dilation of targeted arterioles. This propagation of vasodilation is independent of the direction of blood flow within each arteriole. We also find evidence of a decay phase that acts with a more uniform spatial dependence, rather than along targeted vessels, causing the periphery of the responding region to return to baseline first. We hypothesize that different underlying cellular mechanisms/signaling pathways are responsible for the response initiation and the response decay. Our results advance the fundamental understanding of the hemodynamic response, as well as our ability to evaluate potential cellular mechanisms for their involvement in neurovascular coupling.},

Here we demonstrate that fluid shear stress elicits the phosphorylation of eNOS on tyrosine and serine residues.

These data suggest that shear stress activates a pathway involving PI3K and the serine/threonine kinase Akt, which phosphorylates eNOS. This phosphorylation directly increases eNOS activity at resting [Ca2+]i, thus rendering the shear stress-induced activation of eNOS apparently Ca2+-independent.},

abstract = {Normal brain function requires proper supply of oxygen and glucose in a timely and local manner. This is achieved through an orchestrated intercellular communication between neurones, astrocytes and microvessels that results in a rapid and restricted increase in cerebral blood flow, a process known as neurovascular coupling. Astrocytic end-feet make close contacts with neuronal synapses and blood vessels and, given their ability to release vasoactive signals following neuronal activation, have been recognized as key intermediaries in the neurovascular response. Both dilating and constricting signals appear to be released from astrocytes upon increases in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, and both dilatation and constriction of brain vessels have been observed in previous studies. In this article, we discuss the various astrocyte-derived vasodilating and vasoconstricting signals, their interactions and effects on astrocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, and suggest the importance of the intrinsic properties of the latter cell type on the overall neurovascular response. We present a working model in which the rise in astrocytic Ca(2+) following neuronal activation leads not only to the rapid activation of calcium-activated K(+) channels in astrocytic end-feet, but also to their modulation by metabolites of the arachidonic acid pathway, which in general have been proposed to act on vascular smooth muscle cells rather than on astrocytes. We propose that this latter mechanism may in turn modulate K(+) signalling from astrocytes to smooth muscle cells, influencing the overall effects of the vasodilating and vasoconstricting signals released during neuronal activation.},

abstract = {beta-Amyloid protein (A beta) is the major component of the senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and microglial cells have been shown to be closely associated with these plaques. However, the roles of A beta and microglial cells in pathogenesis of AD remain unclear. Incubation of rat microglial cells with A beta(1-40) caused a significant increase in nitrite, a stable metabolite of nitric oxide (NO), in culture media, while there was no detectable increase in nitrite in astrocyte-rich glial cells or cortical neurons after incubation with A beta(1-40). Nitrite production by microglial cells was also induced by A beta(1-42), but not A beta(25-35). An inhibitor of NO synthase, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA), as well as dexamethasone and actinomycin D, dose-dependently inhibited this nitrite production. Among the various cytokines investigated such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), only IFN-gamma markedly enhanced A beta-dependent nitrite production. Cultured cortical neurons were injured by microglial cells stimulated with A beta in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of IFN-gamma. Neurotoxicity caused by the A beta plus IFN-gamma-stimulated microglial cells was significantly attenuated by NMMA. Thus, although further investigations into the effect of A beta on human microglial cells are needed, it is likely that A beta-induced NO production by microglial cells is one mechanism of the neuronal death in AD.},

abstract = {Neurovascular coupling in response to stimulation of the rat barrel cortex was investigated using concurrent multichannel electrophysiology and laser Doppler flowmetry. The data were used to build a linear dynamic model relating neural activity to blood flow. Local field potential time series were subject to current source density analysis, and the time series of a layer IV sink of the barrel cortex was used as the input to the model. The model output was the time series of the changes in regional cerebral blood flow (CBF). We show that this model can provide excellent fit of the CBF responses for stimulus durations of up to 16 s. The structure of the model consisted of two coupled components representing vascular dilation and constriction. The complex temporal characteristics of the CBF time series were reproduced by the relatively simple balance of these two components. We show that the impulse response obtained under the 16-s duration stimulation condition generalised to provide a good prediction to the data from the shorter duration stimulation conditions. Furthermore, by optimising three out of the total of nine model parameters, the variability in the data can be well accounted for over a wide range of stimulus conditions. By establishing linearity, classic system analysis methods can be used to generate and explore a range of equivalent model structures (e.g., feed-forward or feedback) to guide the experimental investigation of the control of vascular dilation and constriction following stimulation.},

abstract = {While a range of cellular mechanisms have been proposed to underlie control of neurovascular coupling, a comprehensive, reconciliatory model has yet to be determined. To fit with such a model, it is essential that candidate mechanisms exhibit reaction times, spatial ranges, and speeds of propagation that are consistent with the vascular manifestations of the 'hemodynamic response'. Understanding these vascular dynamics is therefore a critical step towards developing a robust model of neurovascular coupling. In this study, we utilize high-speed optical imaging of exposed rodent somatosensory cortex to explore and characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface vessels during functional hyperemia. Our high-speed, high-resolution optical imaging approach allows us to study the hemodynamic response independently in individual vessels, and in discrete regions of the parenchyma with enough resolution to precisely characterize subtle spatial and temporal features of the response. Specifically, we explore when and where the first hemodynamic changes occur in response to stimuli, the direction and speed at which these changes propagate in arterioles and regions of the parenchyma, and the relative timing at which each of these compartments returns to its original baseline state. From these results, we are able to conclude that the hemodynamic response appears to initiate in the parenchyma and then spreads rapidly to surface arterioles. Following the initial onset we find evidence that the response spreads spatially outwards via the dilation of targeted arterioles. This propagation of vasodilation is independent of the direction of blood flow within each arteriole. We also find evidence of a decay phase that acts with a more uniform spatial dependence, rather than along targeted vessels, causing the periphery of the responding region to return to baseline first. We hypothesize that different underlying cellular mechanisms/signaling pathways are responsible for the response initiation and the response decay. Our results advance the fundamental understanding of the hemodynamic response, as well as our ability to evaluate potential cellular mechanisms for their involvement in neurovascular coupling.},

abstract = {Modern neuroimaging techniques rely on neurovascular coupling to show regions of increased brain activation. However, little is known of the neurovascular coupling relationships that exist for inhibitory signals. To address this issue directly we developed a preparation to investigate the signal sources of one of these proposed inhibitory neurovascular signals, the negative blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response (NBR), in rat somatosensory cortex. We found a reliable NBR measured in rat somatosensory cortex in response to unilateral electrical whisker stimulation, which was located in deeper cortical layers relative to the positive BOLD response. Separate optical measurements (two-dimensional optical imaging spectroscopy and laser Doppler flowmetry) revealed that the NBR was a result of decreased blood volume and flow and increased levels of deoxyhemoglobin. Neural activity in the NBR region, measured by multichannel electrodes, varied considerably as a function of cortical depth. There was a decrease in neuronal activity in deep cortical laminae. After cessation of whisker stimulation there was a large increase in neural activity above baseline. Both the decrease in neuronal activity and increase above baseline after stimulation cessation correlated well with the simultaneous measurement of blood flow suggesting that the NBR is related to decreases in neural activity in deep cortical layers. Interestingly, the magnitude of the neural decrease was largest in regions showing stimulus-evoked positive BOLD responses. Since a similar type of neural suppression in surround regions was associated with a negative BOLD signal, the increased levels of suppression in positive BOLD regions could importantly moderate the size of the observed BOLD response.},

abstract = {Free nitric oxide (NO) activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), an enzyme, within both pulmonary and vascular smooth muscle. sGC catalyzes the cyclization of guanosine 5'-triphosphate to guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP). Binding rates of NO to the ferrous heme(s) of sGC have been measured in vitro. However, a missing link in our understanding of the control mechanism of sGC by NO is a comprehensive in vivo kinetic analysis. Available literature data suggests that NO dissociation from the heme center of sGC is accelerated by its interaction with one or more cofactors in vivo. We present a working model for sGC activation and NO consumption in vivo. Our model predicts that NO influences the cGMP formation rate over a concentration range of approximately 5-100 nM (apparent Michaelis constant approximately 23 nM), with Hill coefficients between 1.1 and 1.5. The apparent reaction order for NO consumption by sGC is dependent on NO concentration, and varies between 0 and 1.5. Finally, the activation of sGC (half-life approximately 1-2 s) is much more rapid than deactivation (approximately 50 s). We conclude that control of sGC in vivo is most likely ultra-sensitive, and that activation in vivo occurs at lower NO concentrations than previously reported.},

abstract = {S100B is an EF-hand calcium-binding protein that exerts both intracellular and extracellular effects on a variety of cellular processes. The protein is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system by astrocytes, both physiologically and during the course of neurological disease. In the healthy adult brain and during development, constitutive S100B expression acts as a trophic factor to drive neurite extension and to referee neuroplasticity. Yet, when induced during central nervous system disease, the protein can take on maladaptive roles and thereby exacerbate brain pathology. Based on genetic and pharmacological lines of evidence, we consider such deleterious roles of S100B in two common brain pathologies: ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In rodent models of ischemic brain damage, S100B is induced early on during the subacute phase, where it exacerbates gliosis and delayed infarct expansion and thereby worsens functional recovery. In mouse models of AD, S100B drives brain inflammation and gliosis that accelerate cerebral amyloidosis. Pharmacological inhibition of S100B synthesis mitigates hallmark pathologies of both brain diseases, opening the door for translational approaches to treat these devastating neurological disorders.},

abstract = {A numerical model of neurovascular coupling (NVC) is presented based on neuronal activity coupled to vasodilation/contraction models via the astrocytic mediated perivascular K(+) and the smooth muscle cell Ca(2+) pathway. Luminal agonists acting on P2Y receptors on the endothelial cell surface provide a flux of IP3 into the endothelial cytosol. This concentration of IP3 is transported via gap junctions between endothelial and smooth muscle cells providing a source of sacroplasmic derived Ca(2+) in the smooth muscle cell. The model is able to relate a neuronal input signal to the corresponding vessel reaction. Results indicate that blood flow mediated IP3 production via the agonist ATP has a substantial effect on the contraction/dilation dynamics of the SMC. The resulting variation in cytosolic Ca(2+) can enhance and inhibit the flow of blood to the cortical tissue. IP3 coupling between endothelial and smooth muscle cells seems to be important in the dynamics of the smooth muscle cell. The VOCC channels are, due to the hyperpolarisation from K(+) SMC efflux, almost entirely closed and do not seem to play a significant role during neuronal activity. The current model shows that astrocytic Ca(2+) is not necessary for neurovascular coupling to occur in contrast to a number of experiments outlining the importance of astrocytic Ca(2+) in NVC, however this Ca(2+) pathway is not the only one mediating NVC. Importantly agonists in flowing blood have a significant influence on the endothelial and smooth muscle cell dynamics.},

abstract = {Neural activities trigger regional vasodilation in the brain. Diffusible messengers such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostanoids are considered to work as vasodilators in neurovascular coupling. However, their roles are still controversial. In the present study, cortical images of neural activities and vasodilation were recorded through the intact skull of C57BL/6 mice anesthetized with urethane. Flavoprotein fluorescence responses elicited by vibratory hindpaw stimulation were followed by darkening of arteriole images reflecting vasodilation in the somatosensory cortex. Vasodilation was also observed in light reflection images at the wavelength of 570 nm in the same mice. We perfused the surface of the cortex under the skull with 100 $\mu$M NG-nitro-l-arginine (l-NA), an inhibitor of NO synthase (NOS), and 10 $\mu$M indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX). These drugs suppressed vasodilation without changing flavoprotein fluorescence responses. A mixture of l-NA and indomethacin almost completely eliminated vasodilation. In mice lacking neuronal NOS (nNOS), activity-dependent vasodilation was significantly suppressed compared with that in littermate control mice, while that in mice lacking cytosolic phospholipase A2 $\alpha$ (cPLA2$\alpha$) was unchanged. These results indicate that NO works as a vasodilator in neurovascular coupling of the mouse somatosensory cortex. © 2007.},

abstract = {Amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptides are proteolytic products from amyloid precursor protein (APP) and are thought to play a role in Alzheimer disease (AD) pathogenesis. While much is known about molecular mechanisms underlying cerebral A$\beta$ accumulation in familial AD, less is known about the cause(s) of brain amyloidosis in sporadic disease. Animal and postmortem studies suggest that A$\beta$ secretion can be up-regulated in response to hypoxia. We employed a new technology (Single Molecule Arrays, SiMoA) capable of ultrasensitive protein measurements and developed a novel assay to look for changes in serum A$\beta$42 concentration in 25 resuscitated patients with severe hypoxia due to cardiac arrest. After a lag period of 10 or more hours, very clear serum A$\beta$42 elevations were observed in all patients. Elevations ranged from approximately 80\% to over 70-fold, with most elevations in the range of 3-10-fold (average approximately 7-fold). The magnitude of the increase correlated with clinical outcome. These data provide the first direct evidence in living humans that ischemia acutely increases A$\beta$ levels in blood. The results point to the possibility that hypoxia may play a role in the amyloidogenic process of AD.},

abstract = {Neuronal activity evokes localized changes in blood flow. Although this response, termed neurovascular coupling, is widely used to monitor human brain function and diagnose pathology, the cellular mechanisms that mediate the response remain unclear. We investigated the contribution of glial cells to neurovascular coupling in the acutely isolated mammalian retina. We found that light stimulation and glial cell stimulation can both evoke dilation or constriction of arterioles. Light-evoked and glial-evoked vasodilations were blocked by inhibitors of cytochrome P450 epoxygenase, the synthetic enzyme for epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. Vasoconstrictions, in contrast, were blocked by an inhibitor of omega-hydroxylase, which synthesizes 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Nitric oxide influenced whether vasodilations or vasoconstrictions were produced in response to light and glial stimulation. Light-evoked vasoactivity was blocked when neuron-to-glia signaling was interrupted by a purinergic antagonist. These results indicate that glial cells contribute to neurovascular coupling and suggest that regulation of blood flow may involve both vasodilating and vasoconstricting components.},

abstract = {To detect nitric oxide (NO) in the rat brain during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was employed with the NO trapping technique, using an iron and N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC) complex. An X-band (about 9.5 GHz) EPR system detected a triplet signal (g = 2.038) derived from an NO-Fe-DETC complex being superimposed on the g(perpendicular) signal of Cu-DETC complex at liquid nitrogen temperature. The height of the triplet signal peaked seven hours after injection of 40 mg/kg of LPS, and over 25 x 10(4) U/kg of IFN-gamma enhanced the LPS-induced NO formation. Pretreatment with N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA), an NO synthase inhibitor, deleted only the triplet signal. A triplet signal (g(iso) = 2.040, aN = 1.28 mT) derived from the NO-Fe-DETC complex was also observed at ambient temperature. Then, a home-built 700 MHz EPR system was used to detect an NO signal in the septic rat brain in vivo. We successfully monitored the NO-Fe-DETC signal in the head region of a living rat under the condition that provided maximum height of the NO-Fe-DETC signal in the X-band EPR study. Pretreatment with NMMA again deleted the NO-Fe-DETC signal. This is the first EPR observation of endogenous NO in the brain of living rats.},

abstract = {The mechanisms by which hypoxia causes vasoconstriction in vivo are not known. Accumulating evidence implicates the endothelium as a key regulator of vascular tone. Hypoxia induces the expression and secretion of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor in cultured human endothelial cells. We report here that nitric oxide (NO), an endothelial-derived relaxing factor, modifies this induction of ET-1. Whereas low oxygen tension (PO2 = 20-30 Torr) increases ET-1 expression four- to eightfold above that seen at normal oxygen tension (PO2 = 150 Torr), sodium nitroprusside, which releases NO, suppresses this effect. This inhibition of hypoxia-induced ET-1 expression occurs within the first hour of exposure of cells to sodium nitroprusside. Moreover, when the endogenous constitutive levels of NO made by endothelial cells are suppressed using N-omega-nitro-L-arginine, a potent competitive inhibitor of NO synthase, the baseline levels of ET-1 produced in normoxic environments are increased three- to fourfold. The effects of hypoxia and the NO synthase inhibitor on ET-1 expression are additive. The regulation of ET-1 production by NO appears to be at the level of transcription. Similar effects of NO were observed on the expression of the PDGF-B chain gene. PDGF-B expression was suppressed by NO in a hypoxic environment and induced by N-omega-nitro-L-arginine in both normoxic and hypoxic environments. These findings suggest that in addition to its role as a vasodilator, NO may also influence vascular tone via the regulated reciprocal production of ET-1 and PDGF-B in the vasculature.},

Knowledge of how these cells control blood flow is crucial for understanding how neural computation is powered, for interpreting functional imaging scans of brains, and for developing treatments for neurological disorders. It is now recognized that neurotransmitter-mediated signalling has a key role in regulating cerebral blood flow, that much of this control is mediated by astrocytes, that oxygen modulates blood flow regulation, and that blood flow may be controlled by capillaries as well as by arterioles. These conceptual shifts in our understanding of cerebral blood flow control have important implications for the development of new therapeutic approaches.},

abstract = {Spontaneous contraction and relaxation of arteries (and in some instances venules) has been termed vasomotion and has been observed in an extensive variety of tissues and species. However, its functions and underlying mechanisms are still under discussion. We demonstrate that in vivo spectrophotometry, measured simultaneously with extracellular recordings at the same locations in the visual thalamus of the cat, reveals vasomotion, measured as an oscillation (0.14 hz) in the recorded oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) signal, which appears spontaneously in the microcirculation and can last for periods of hours. During some non-oscillatory periods, maintained sensory stimulation evokes vasomotion lasting \~{}30s, resembling an adaptive vascular phenomenon. This oscillation in the oxyhaemoblobin signal is sensitive to pharmacological manipulation: it is inducible by chloralose anaesthesia and it can be temporarily blocked by systemic administration of adrenaline or acetylcholine (ACh). During these oscillatory periods, neurovascular coupling (i.e. the relationship between local neural activity and the rate of blood supply to that location) appears significantly altered. This raises important questions with regard to the interpretation of results from studies currently dependent upon a linear relationship between neural activity and blood flow, such as neuroimaging.},

Are these cells only filling up the space and passively nurturing the neurons, or do they also contribute to information transfer and processing? After several years of intense research since the pioneer discovery of astrocytic calcium waves and glutamate release onto neurons in vitro, the neuronal-glial studies have answered many questions thanks to technological advances. However, the definitive in vivo role of astrocytes remains to be addressed. In addition, it is becoming clear that diverse populations of astrocytes coexist with different molecular identities and specialized functions adjusted to their microenvironment, but do they all belong to the umbrella family of astrocytes? One population of astrocytes takes on a new function by displaying both support cell and stem cell characteristics in the neurogenic niches. Here, we define characteristics that classify a cell as an astrocyte under physiological conditions. We will also discuss the well-established and emerging functions of astrocytes with an emphasis on their roles on neuronal activity and as neural stem cells in adult neurogenic zones.},

Dysregulation of intracellular calcium signalling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. Increased intracellular calcium elicits the characteristic lesions of this disorder, including the accumulation of amyloid-$\beta$, the hyperphosphorylation of TAU and neuronal death. Conversely, neurodegeneration that is induced by amyloid-$\beta$ or TAU is probably mediated by changes in calcium homeostasis. Disruption of calcium regulation in the endoplasmic reticulum mediates the most significant signal-transduction cascades that are associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Moreover, mutations that cause familial Alzheimer’s disease have been linked to intracellular calcium signalling pathways. Destabilization of calcium signalling seems to be central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease, and targeting this process might be therapeutically beneficial.},

abstract = {Flow-induced production of nitric oxide (NO) by endothelial cells plays a fundamental role in vascular homeostasis. However, the mechanisms by which shear stress activates NO production remain unclear due in part to limitations in measuring NO, especially under flow conditions. Shear stress elicits the release of ATP, but the relative contribution of autocrine stimulation by ATP to flow-induced NO production has not been established. Furthermore, the importance of calcium in shear stress-induced NO production remains controversial, and in particular the role of capacitive calcium entry (CCE) has yet to be determined. We have utilized our unique NO measurement device to investigate the role of ATP autocrine signaling and CCE in shear stress-induced NO production. We found that endogenously released ATP and downstream activation of purinergic receptors and CCE plays a significant role in shear stress-induced NO production. ATP-induced eNOS phophorylation under static conditions is also dependent on CCE. Inhibition of protein kinase C significantly inhibited eNOS phosphorylation and the calcium response. To our knowledge, we are the first to report on the role of CCE in the mechanism of acute shear stress-induced NO response. In addition, our work highlights the importance of ATP autocrine signaling in shear stress-induced NO production.},

abstract = {1. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded under whole-cell voltage clamp from granule cells in slices of rat cerebellum. EPSCs from individual mossy fibre inputs were identified by their all-or-none appearance in response to a graded stimulus. Excitatory synaptic transmission was investigated at room temperature (approximately 24 degrees C) and at near-physiological temperature (approximately 34 degrees C) by analysing current fluctuations in the peak and decay of the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (non-NMDA) component of EPSCs. 2. In a subset of synapses the mean EPSC amplitude remained unchanged as the probability of transmitter release was substantially lowered by raising the extracellular Mg2+ and lowering Ca2+. These synapses were considered to have only one functional release site. Single-site synapses had small EPSCs (139 16 pS, n = 5, at 24 degrees C) with a large coefficient of variation (c.v. = 0.23 0.02, n = 5) and an amplitude distribution that was well fitted by a Gaussian distribution in four out of five cases. The EPSC latency had a unimodal distribution and its standard deviation had a temperature dependence with a temperature coefficient (Q10; range, 24-35 degrees C) of 2.4 0.4 (n = 4). 3. Peak-scaled non-stationary fluctuation analysis of single-site EPSCs indicated that the mean conductance of the underlying non-NMDA channels was 12 2 pS (n = 4) at 35 degrees C. Upper and lower limits for mean channel open probability (Po), calculated from fluctuations in the EPSC peak amplitude, were 0.51 and 0.38, respectively. These estimates, together with the open probability of the channel when bound by transmitter, suggest that only about 50\% of the non-NMDA channels were occupied following the release of a quantum of transmitter. 4. At some multi-site synapses EPSCs had a low c.v. (0.4 0.01, n = 5) at 34 degrees C and non-stationary fluctuation analysis gave a parabolic variance-mean current relationship. This suggests that practically all of the non-NMDA receptors were occupied by glutamate at the peak of EPSC. The channel open probability (Po = 0.84 0.03, n = 5) at these 'saturated' multi-site synapses will therefore equal the open probability of the channel when bound by transmitter (Po,max). 5. Non-stationary fluctuation analysis of EPSCs from 'saturating' multi-site synapses indicated that 170 40 postsynaptic non-NMDA channels were exposed to transmitter at the peak of the EPSC. The mean conductance of the synaptic channels was 10 2 pS (n = 5) at 34 degrees C. 6. At synapses with multiple release sites the EPSC decay time became faster when release probability was lowered (by reducing the external Ca2+/Mg2+ ratio), indicating that the transmitter concentration profile depended on release probability. No such speeding of the EPSC decay was observed at single-site synapses. 7. Our results suggest that release of a packet of transmitter from a single release site does not saturate postsynaptic non-NMDA receptors at cerebellar mossy fibre-granule cell synapses. However, at multi-site synapses transmitter released from neighbouring sites can overlap, changing the transmitter concentration profile in the synaptic cleft. We conclude that the level of postsynaptic receptor occupancy can depend on the probability of transmitter release at individual multi-site synapses.},

There clearly is still an enormous amount of experimental and theoretical work to be done to unravel the precise mechanism of neurovascular coupling, but over the last decade significant advances have been made. The most recent studies confirm the original finding that the activation of Ca(2+) elevations in astrocyte endfeet is an essential step but also reveal new levels of complexity in the astrocyte control of neurovascular coupling. The recent evidence for a link between Ca(2+) signalling in astrocytes and local metabolic states of the brain tissue has broad implications for the interpretation of data from functional brain imaging studies. Unraveling the full molecular mechanism of the astrocyte control of cerebral blood flow represents a formidable challenge in neurobiological research in the years to come that might also create opportunities for the development of new therapeutic strategies for cerebrovascular diseases such as ischemic stroke, hypertension and migraine as well as neurodegenerative diseases as Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {The neurovascular unit (NVU) comprises brain endothelial cells, pericytes or vascular smooth muscle cells, glia and neurons. The NVU controls blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and cerebral blood flow, and maintains the chemical composition of the neuronal 'milieu', which is required for proper functioning of neuronal circuits. Recent evidence indicates that BBB dysfunction is associated with the accumulation of several vasculotoxic and neurotoxic molecules within brain parenchyma, a reduction in cerebral blood flow, and hypoxia. Together, these vascular-derived insults might initiate and/or contribute to neuronal degeneration. This article examines mechanisms of BBB dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders, notably Alzheimer's disease, and highlights therapeutic opportunities relating to these neurovascular deficits.},

abstract = {Low nanomolar concentrations of nitric oxide activate guanylyl cyclase to produce cGMP, which has diverse physiological effects. Higher concentrations inhibit mitochondrial respiration at cytochrome c oxidase and this has been proposed to be important physiologically, increasing oxygen permeation into tissue (by reducing the oxygen use of cells near blood vessels), activating AMP kinase, and regulating the relationship between cerebral blood flow and oxygen use. It is unclear, however, whether nitric oxide can accumulate physiologically to concentrations at which inhibition of respiration occurs. In rat cerebellar slices, we activated nitric oxide production from each isoform of nitric oxide synthase. Only activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase, which is expressed pathologically, caused any significant inhibition of respiration. Modelling oxygen and nitric oxide concentrations predicted that, in vivo, physiological nitric oxide levels are too low to affect respiration. Even pathologically, the nitric oxide concentration may only rise to 2.5 nm, producing a 1.5\% inhibition of respiration. Thus, under physiological conditions, nitric oxide signals do not inhibit respiration but are well-tuned to the dynamic range of guanylyl cyclase activation.},

It is believed that the environmental risk factors play an important role in the onset and development of AD. Patients suffering from cerebral ischemia and stroke in which hypoxic conditions occur are much more susceptible to AD. Increasing evidence suggests that hypoxia facilitates the pathogenesis of AD through accelerating the accumulation of Abeta, increasing the hyperphosphorylation of tau, impairing the normal functions of blood-brain barrier, and promoting the degeneration of neurons. Further investigations into the relationship between hypoxia and AD may open the avenue for effective preservation and pharmacological treatments of this neurodegenerative disease.},

abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is formed by brain endothelial cells lining the cerebral microvasculature, and is an important mechanism for protecting the brain from fluctuations in plasma composition, and from circulating agents such as neurotransmitters and xenobiotics capable of disturbing neural function. The barrier also plays an important role in the homeostatic regulation of the brain microenvironment necessary for the stable and co-ordinated activity of neurones. The BBB phenotype develops under the influence of associated brain cells, especially astrocytic glia, and consists of more complex tight junctions than in other capillary endothelia, and a number of specific transport and enzyme systems which regulate molecular traffic across the endothelial cells. Transporters characteristic of the BBB phenotype include both uptake mechanisms (e.g. GLUT-1 glucose carrier, L1 amino acid transporter) and efflux transporters (e.g. P-glycoprotein). In addition to a role in long-term barrier induction and maintenance, astrocytes and other cells can release chemical factors that modulate endothelial permeability over a time-scale of seconds to minutes. Cell culture models, both primary and cell lines, have been used to investigate aspects of barrier induction and modulation. Conditioned medium taken from growing glial cells can reproduce some of the inductive effects, evidence for involvement of diffusible factors. However, for some features of endothelial differentiation and induction, the extracellular matrix plays an important role. Several candidate molecules have been identified, capable of mimicking aspects of glial-mediated barrier induction of brain endothelium; these include TGFbeta, GDNF, bFGF, IL-6 and steroids. In addition, factors secreted by brain endothelial cells including leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) have been shown to induce astrocytic differentiation. Thus endothelium and astrocytes are involved in two-way induction. Short-term modulation of brain endothelial permeability has been shown for a number of small chemical mediators produced by astrocytes and other nearby cell types. It is clear that endothelial cells are involved in both long- and short-term chemical communication with neighbouring cells, with the perivascular end feet of astrocytes being of particular importance. The role of barrier induction and modulation in normal physiology and in pathology is discussed.},

abstract = {The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is only partially understood. $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) is physiologically generated by sequential cleavage of its precursor protein by the $\beta$- and the $\gamma$-secretase and it is normally disposed of. In Alzheimer's disease, A$\beta$ is excessively produced or less dismissed, but the hypothesis on its physiological and pathological role are heterogeneous and often discordant. It has been described a positive feedback loop from the $\gamma$- to the $\beta$-secretase cleavages of A$\beta$ precursor protein, which is activated by mutations of Presenilin 1 (PS1), the catalytic core of the $\gamma$-secretase. These findings show that A$\beta$ precursor protein as well the activity of the $\gamma$-secretase are required to obtain the up-regulation of $\beta$-secretase which is induced by Presenilin 1 mutations. Then, A$\beta$ 1-42 is the A$\beta$ precursor protein derivative that up-regulates the expression of $\beta$-secretase, and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun and ERK1/2 are involved. Here, we describe the activation of $\beta$-secretase and c-jun N-terminal kinase related proteins by monomeric A$\beta$ 1-42, defining the conditions that most efficiently strike the described signaling without producing toxicity. Taken together these data imply that monomeric A$\beta$ 1-42, at non-toxic concentrations and time frames, are able to induce a signaling pathway that leads to transcriptional activation of $\beta$-secretase.},

NO plays an important role in the protection against the onset and progression of cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease is associated with a number of different disorders including hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension and diabetes. The underlying pathology for most cardiovascular diseases is atherosclerosis, which is in turn associated with endothelial dysfunctional. The cardioprotective roles of NO include regulation of blood pressure and vascular tone, inhibition of platelet aggregation and leukocyte adhesion, and prevention smooth muscle cell proliferation. Reduced bioavailability of NO is thought to be one of the central factors common to cardiovascular disease, although it is unclear whether this is a cause of, or result of, endothelial dysfunction. Disturbances in NO bioavailability leads to a loss of the cardio protective actions and in some case may even increase disease progression. In this chapter the cellular and biochemical mechanisms leading to reduced NO bioavailability are discussed and evidence for the prevalence of these mechanisms in cardiovascular disease evaluated.},

abstract = {Shear stress stimulates nitric oxide (NO) production by phosphorylating endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) at Ser(1179) in a phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)- and protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent manner. The eNOS has additional potential phosphorylation sites, including Ser(116), Thr(497), and Ser(635). Here, we studied these potential phosphorylation sites in response to shear, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and 8-bromocAMP (8-BRcAMP) in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). All three stimuli induced phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser(635), which was consistently slower than that at Ser(1179). Thr(497) was rapidly dephosphorylated by 8-BRcAMP but not by shear and VEGF. None of the stimuli phosphorylated Ser(116). Whereas shear-stimulated Ser(635) phosphorylation was not affected by phosphoinositide-3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY-294002, it was blocked by either treating the cells with a PKA inhibitor H89 or infecting them with a recombinant adenovirus-expressing PKA inhibitor. These results suggest that shear stress stimulates eNOS by two different mechanisms: 1) PKA- and PI3K-dependent and 2) PKA-dependent but PI3K-independent pathways. Phosphorylation of Ser(635) may play an important role in chronic regulation of eNOS in response to mechanical and humoral stimuli.},

Nitric oxide mediates a plethora of physiological functions, for example, maintenance of vascular tone and inflammation. Apart from these physiological functions, NO is also involved in the pathophysiology of various disorders, specifically those in which regulation of blood flow and inflammation has a key role.

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. In connection with the global trend of prolonging human life and the increasing number of elderly in the population, the AD becomes one of the most serious health and socioeconomic problems of the present. Tau protein promotes assembly and stabilizes microtubules, which contributes to the proper function of neuron. Alterations in the amount or the structure of tau protein can affect its role as a stabilizer of microtubules as well as some of the processes in which it is implicated. The molecular mechanisms governing tau aggregation are mainly represented by several posttranslational modifications that alter its structure and conformational state. Hence, abnormal phosphorylation and truncation of tau protein have gained attention as key mechanisms that become tau protein in a pathological entity. Evidences about the clinicopathological significance of phosphorylated and truncated tau have been documented during the progression of AD as well as their capacity to exert cytotoxicity when expressed in cell and animal models. This paper describes the normal structure and function of tau protein and its major alterations during its pathological aggregation in AD.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is a relative newcomer to pharmacology, as the paper which initiated the field was published only 25 years ago. Nevertheless its impact is such that to date more than 31,000 papers have been published with NO in the title and more than 65,000 refer to it in some way. The identification of NO with endothelium-derived relaxing factor and the discovery of its synthesis from L-arginine led to the realisation that the L-arginine: NO pathway is widespread and plays a variety of physiological roles. These include the maintenance of vascular tone, neurotransmitter function in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, and mediation of cellular defence. In addition, NO interacts with mitochondrial systems to regulate cell respiration and to augment the generation of reactive oxygen species, thus triggering mechanisms of cell survival or death. This review will focus on the role of NO in the cardiovascular system where, in addition to maintaining a vasodilator tone, it inhibits platelet aggregation and adhesion and modulates smooth muscle cell proliferation. NO has been implicated in a number of cardiovascular diseases and virtually every risk factor for these appears to be associated with a reduction in endothelial generation of NO. Reduced basal NO synthesis or action leads to vasoconstriction, elevated blood pressure and thrombus formation. By contrast, overproduction of NO leads to vasodilatation, hypotension, vascular leakage, and disruption of cell metabolism. Appropriate pharmacological or molecular biological manipulation of the generation of NO will doubtless prove beneficial in such conditions.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in autocrine and paracrine manner in numerous physiological processes, including regulation of blood pressure and blood flow, platelet aggregation, and leukocyte adhesion. In vascular wall, most of the bioavailable NO is believed to derive from endothelial cell NO synthase (eNOS). Recently, neuronal NOS (nNOS) has been identified as a source of NO in the vicinity of microvessels and has been shown to participate in vascular function. Thus NO can be produced and transported to the vascular smooth muscle cells from 1). endothelial cells and 2). perivascular nerve fibers, mast cells, and other nNOS-containing sources. In this study, a mathematical model of NO diffusion-reaction in a cylindrical arteriolar segment was formulated. The model quantifies the relative contribution of these NO sources and the smooth muscle availability of NO in a tissue containing an arteriolar blood vessel. The results indicate that a source of NO derived through nNOS in the perivascular region can be a significant contributor to smooth muscle NO. Predicted smooth muscle NO concentrations are as high as 430 nM, which is consistent with reported experimental measurements approximately 400 nM). In addition, we used the model to analyze the smooth muscle NO availability in 1). eNOS and nNOS knockout experiments, 2). the presence of myoglobin, and 3). the presence of cell-free Hb, e.g., Hb-based oxygen carriers. The results show that NO release by nNOS would significantly affect available smooth muscle NO. Further experimental and theoretical studies are required to account for distribution of NOS isoforms and determine NO availability in vasculatures of different tissues.},

abstract = {S100B is an EF-hand calcium-binding protein that exerts both intracellular and extracellular effects on a variety of cellular processes. The protein is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system by astrocytes, both physiologically and during the course of neurological disease. In the healthy adult brain and during development, constitutive S100B expression acts as a trophic factor to drive neurite extension and to referee neuroplasticity. Yet, when induced during central nervous system disease, the protein can take on maladaptive roles and thereby exacerbate brain pathology. Based on genetic and pharmacological lines of evidence, we consider such deleterious roles of S100B in two common brain pathologies: ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In rodent models of ischemic brain damage, S100B is induced early on during the subacute phase, where it exacerbates gliosis and delayed infarct expansion and thereby worsens functional recovery. In mouse models of AD, S100B drives brain inflammation and gliosis that accelerate cerebral amyloidosis. Pharmacological inhibition of S100B synthesis mitigates hallmark pathologies of both brain diseases, opening the door for translational approaches to treat these devastating neurological disorders.},

abstract = {L-Arginine is the only endogenous nitrogen-containing substrate of NO synthase (NOS), and it thus governs the production of NO during nervous system development as well as in disease states such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and HIV dementia. The "arginine paradox" refers to the dependence of cellular NO production on exogenous L-arginine concentration despite the theoretical saturation of NOS enzymes with intracellular L-arginine. Herein, we report that decreased availability of L-arginine blocked induction of NO production in cytokine-stimulated astrocytes, owing to inhibition of inducible NOS (iNOS) protein expression. However, activity of the promoter of the iNOS gene, induction of iNOS mRNA, and stability of iNOS protein were not inhibited under these conditions. Our results indicate that inhibition of iNOS activity by arginine depletion in stimulated astrocyte cultures occurs via inhibition of translation of iNOS mRNA. After stimulation by cytokines, uptake of L-arginine negatively regulates the phosphorylation status of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF2 alpha), which, in turn, regulates translation of iNOS mRNA. eIF2 alpha phosphorylation correlates with phosphorylation of the mammalian homolog of yeast GCN2 eIF2 alpha kinase. As the kinase activity of GCN2 is activated by phosphorylation, these findings suggest that GCN2 activity represents a proximal step in the iNOS translational regulation by availability of l-arginine. These results provide an explanation for the arginine paradox for iNOS and define a distinct mechanism by which a substrate can regulate the activity of its associated enzyme.},

abstract = {Administration of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) frequently results in vasoconstriction that is primarily attributed to the scavenging of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) by cell-free hemoglobin. The ensuing pressor response could be caused by the high NO reactivity of HBOC in the vascular lumen and/or the extravasation of hemoglobin molecules. There is a need for quantitative understanding of the NO interaction with HBOC in the blood vessels. We developed a detailed mathematical model of NO diffusion and reaction in the presence of an HBOC for an arteriolar-size vessel. The HBOC reactivity with NO and degree of extravasation was studied in the range of 2-58 x 10(6) M(-1) x s(-1) and 0-100\%, respectively. The model predictions showed that the addition of HBOC reduced the smooth muscle (SM) NO concentration in the activation range (12-28 nM) for soluble guanylate cyclase, a major determinant of SM contraction. The SM NO concentration was significantly reduced when the extravasation of HBOC molecules was considered. The myoglobin present in the parenchymal cells scavenges NO, which reduces the SM NO concentration.},

abstract = {Background Experimental evidence suggests that flow-dependent dilatation of conduit arteries is mediated by nitric oxide (NO) and/or prostacyclin. The present study was designed to assess whether NO or prostacyclin also contributes to flow-dependent dilatation of conduit arteries in humans. Methods and Results Radial artery internal diameter (ID) was measured continuously in 16 healthy volunteers (age, 24\{+/-\}1 years) with a transcutaneous A-mode echo-tracking system coupled to a Doppler device for the measurement of radial blood flow. In 8 subjects, a catheter was inserted into the brachial artery for measurement of arterial pressure and infusion of the NO synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA; 8 \{micro\}mol/min for 7 minutes; infusion rate, 0.8 mL/min). Flow-dependent dilatation was evaluated before and after L-NMMA or aspirin as the response of the radial artery to an acute increase in flow (reactive hyperemia after a 3-minute cuff wrist occlusion). Under control conditions, release of the occlusion induced a marked increase in radial blood flow (from 24\{+/-\}3 to 73\{+/-\}11 mL/min; P<.01) followed by a delayed increase in radial diameter (flow-mediated dilatation; from 2.67\{+/-\}0.10 to 2.77\{+/-\}0.12 mm; P<.01) without any change in heart rate or arterial pressure. L-NMMA decreased basal forearm blood flow (from 24\{+/-\}3 to 13\{+/-\}3 mL/min; P<.05) without affecting basal radial artery diameter, heart rate, or arterial pressure, whereas aspirin (1 g PO) was without any hemodynamic effect. In the presence of L-NMMA, the peak flow response during hyperemia was not affected (76\{+/-\}12 mL/min), but the duration of the hyperemic response was markedly reduced, and the flow-dependent dilatation of the radial artery was abolished and converted to a vasoconstriction (from 2.62\{+/-\}0.11 to 2.55\{+/-\}0.11 mm; P<.01). In contrast, aspirin did not affect the hyperemic response nor the flow-dependent dilatation of the radial artery. Conclusions The present investigation demonstrates that NO, but not prostacyclin, is essential for flow-mediated dilatation of large human arteries. Hence, this response can be used as a test for the L-arginine/NO pathway in clinical studies.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) produced by vascular endothelial cells is a potent vasodilator and an antiinflammatory mediator. Regulating production of endothelial-derived NO is a complex undertaking, involving multiple signaling and genetic pathways that are activated by diverse humoral and biomechanical stimuli. To gain a thorough understanding of the rich diversity of responses observed experimentally, it is necessary to account for an ensemble of these pathways acting simultaneously. In this article, we have assembled four quantitative molecular pathways previously proposed for shear-stress-induced NO production. In these pathways, endothelial NO synthase is activated 1), via calcium release, 2), via phosphorylation reactions, and 3), via enhanced protein expression. To these activation pathways, we have added a fourth, a pathway describing actual NO production from endothelial NO synthase and its various protein partners. These pathways were combined and simulated using CytoSolve, a computational environment for combining independent pathway calculations. The integrated model is able to describe the experimentally observed change in NO production with time after the application of fluid shear stress.

abstract = {Abstract Nitric oxide (NO) has emerged as a key mediator in the mechanisms of ischaemic tolerance induced by a wide variety of preconditioning stimuli. NO is involved in the brain protection that develops either early (minutes-hours) or late (days-weeks) after the preconditioning stimulus. However, the sources of NO and the mechanisms underlying the protective effects differ substantially. While in early preconditioning NO is produced by the endothelial and neuronal isoform of NO synthase, in delayed preconditioning NO is synthesized by the inducible or 'immunological' isoform of NO synthase. Furthermore, in early preconditioning, NO acts through the canonical cGMP pathway, possibly through protein kinase G and opening of mitochondrial K(ATP) channels. In late preconditioning, the protection is mediated by peroxynitrite formed by the reaction of NO with superoxide derived from the enzyme NADPH oxidase. The mechanisms by which peroxynitrite exerts its protective effect may include improvement of post-ischaemic cerebrovascular function, leading to enhancement of blood flow to the ischaemic territory, and expression of prosurvival genes resulting in cytoprotection. The evidence suggests that NO can engage highly effective and multifunctional prosurvival pathways, which could be exploited for the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular pathologies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: NO-induced dilations in resistance arteries (RAs) are not associated with decreases in vascular smooth muscle cell Ca2+. We tested whether a cGMP-dependent activation of the smooth muscle myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) resulting in a Ca2+ desensitization of the contractile apparatus was the underlying mechanism and whether it could be antagonized by the RhoA pathway.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The Ca2+ sensitivity of RA was assessed as the relation between changes in diameter and [Ca2+]i in depolarized RA (120 mol/L K+) exposed to stepwise increases in Ca2+ex (0 to 3 mmol/L). Effects of 10 micromol/L sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on Ca2+ sensitivity were determined before and after application of the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ (1 micromol/L) and the MLCP inhibitor calyculin A (120 nmol/L) and in presence of the RhoA-activating phospholipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P, 12 nmol/L). SNP-induced dilations were also studied in controls and in RAs pretreated with the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 or transfected with a dominant-negative RhoA mutant (N19RhoA). Constrictions elicited by increasing Ca2+ex were significantly attenuated by SNP, which, however, left associated increases in [Ca2+]i unaffected. This NO-induced attenuation was blocked by ODQ, calyculin A, and S1P. The S1P-induced translocation of RhoA indicating activation of the GTPase was not reversed by SNP. Inhibition of RhoA/Rho kinase by N19RhoA or Y27632 significantly augmented SNP-induced dilations.

CONCLUSIONS: NO dilates RA by activating the MLCP in a cGMP-dependent manner, thereby reducing the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus. MLCP inactivation via the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway antagonizes this Ca2+-desensitizing effect that, in turn, can be restored using RhoA/Rho kinase inhibitors.},

abstract = {Pericytes play a key role in the development of cerebral microcirculation. The exact role of pericytes in the neurovascular unit in the adult brain and during brain aging remains, however, elusive. Using adult viable pericyte-deficient mice, we show that pericyte loss leads to brain vascular damage by two parallel pathways: (1) reduction in brain microcirculation causing diminished brain capillary perfusion, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral blood flow responses to brain activation that ultimately mediates chronic perfusion stress and hypoxia, and (2) blood-brain barrier breakdown associated with brain accumulation of serum proteins and several vasculotoxic and/or neurotoxic macromolecules ultimately leading to secondary neuronal degenerative changes. We show that age-dependent vascular damage in pericyte-deficient mice precedes neuronal degenerative changes, learning and memory impairment, and the neuroinflammatory response. Thus, pericytes control key neurovascular functions that are necessary for proper neuronal structure and function, and pericyte loss results in a progressive age-dependent vascular-mediated neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Vascular endothelium expressing endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) produces nitric oxide (NO), which has a number of important physiological functions in the microvasculature. The rate of NO production by the endothelium is a critical determinant of NO distribution in the vascular wall. We have analyzed the biochemical pathways of NO synthesis and formulated a model to estimate NO production by the microvascular endothelium under physiological conditions. The model quantifies the NO produced by eNOS based on the kinetics of NO synthesis and the availability of eNOS and its intracellular substrates. The predicted NO production from microvessels was in the range of 0.005-0.1 microM/s. This range of predicted values is in agreement with some experimental values but is much lower than other rates previously measured or estimated from experimental data with the help of mathematical modeling. Paradoxical discrepancies between the model predictions and previously reported results based on experimental measurements of NO concentration in the vicinity of the arteriolar wall suggest that NO can also be released through eNOS-independent mechanisms, such as catalysis by neuronal NOS (nNOS). We also used our model to test the sensitivity of NO production to substrate availability, eNOS concentration, and potential rate-limiting factors. The results indicated that the predicted low level of NO production can be attributed primarily to a low expression of eNOS in the microvascular endothelial cells.},

abstract = {Cell-cell communication in astroglial syncytia is mediated by intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) responses elicited by extracellular signaling molecules as well as by diverse physical and chemical stimuli. Despite the evidence that astrocytic swelling promotes [Ca(2+)](i) elevation through Ca(2+) influx, the molecular identity of the channel protein underlying this response is still elusive. Here we report that primary cultured cortical astrocytes express the transient receptor potential vanilloid-related channel 4 (TRPV 4), a Ca(2+)-permeable cation channel gated by a variety of stimuli, including cell swelling. Immunoblot and confocal microscopy analyses confirmed the presence of the channel protein and its localization in the plasma membrane. TRPV4 was functional because the selective TRPV4 agonist 4-alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4alphaPDD) activated an outwardly rectifying cation current with biophysical and pharmacological properties that overlapped those of recombinant human TRPV4 expressed in COS cells. Moreover, 4alphaPDD and hypotonic challenge promoted [Ca(2+)](i) elevation mediated by influx of extracellular Ca(2+). This effect was abolished by low micromolar concentration of the TRPV4 inhibitor Ruthenium Red. Immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy of rat brain revealed that TRPV4 was enriched in astrocytic processes of the superficial layers of the neocortex and in astrocyte end feet facing pia and blood vessels. Collectively, these data indicate that cultured cortical astroglia express functional TRPV4 channels. They also demonstrate that TRPV4 is particularly abundant in astrocytic membranes at the interface between brain and extracerebral liquid spaces. Consistent with its roles in other tissues, these results support the view that TRPV4 might participate in astroglial osmosensation and thus play a key role in brain volume homeostasis.},

The importance of the endfeet is based on the premise that they constitute a complete coverage of the vessel wall. Despite a number of studies based on different microscopic techniques this question has yet to be resolved. We have made an electron microscopic 3D reconstruction of perivascular endfeet in CA1 (stratum moleculare) of rat hippocampus. The endfeet interdigitate and overlap, leaving no slits between them. Only in a few sites do processes--tentatively classified as processes of microglia--extend through the perivascular glial sheath to establish direct contact with the endothelial basal lamina. In contrast to the endfoot covering of the endothelial tube, the endfoot covering of the pericyte is incomplete, allowing neuropil elements to touch the basal lamina that enwraps this type of cell. The 3D reconstruction also revealed large bundles of mitochondria in the endfoot processes that came in close apposition to the perivascular endfoot membrane. Our data support the idea that in pathophysiological conditions, the perivascular astrocytic covering may control the exchange of water and solutes between blood and brain and that free diffusion is limited to narrow clefts between overlapping endfeet.},

Paradoxically, this communication may cause vasoconstriction in some cases. Here, we show that, regardless of the mechanism by which astrocytic endfoot Ca(2+) was elevated, modest increases in Ca(2+) induced dilation, whereas larger increases switched dilation to constriction. Large-conductance, Ca(2+)-sensitive potassium channels in astrocytic endfeet mediated a majority of the dilation and the entire vasoconstriction, implicating local extracellular K(+) as a vasoactive signal for both dilation and constriction. These results provide evidence for a unifying mechanism that explains the nature and apparent duality of the vascular response, showing that the degree and polarity of neurovascular coupling depends on astrocytic endfoot Ca(2+) and perivascular K(+).},

Astrocytes are organized into distinct nonoverlapping domains and extend elaborate and dense fine processes that interact intimately with synapses and cerebrovasculature. The recognition in the mid 1990s that astrocytes undergo elevations in intracellular calcium concentration following activation of G protein-coupled receptors by synaptically released neurotransmitters demonstrated not only that astrocytes display a form of excitability but also that astrocytes may be active participants in brain information processing. The roles that astrocytic calcium elevations play in neurophysiology and especially in modulation of neuronal activity have been intensely researched in recent years.

abstract = {The brain is critically dependent on a continuous supply of blood to function. Therefore, the cerebral vasculature is endowed with neurovascular control mechanisms that assure that the blood supply of the brain is commensurate to the energy needs of its cellular constituents. The regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) during brain activity involves the coordinated interaction of neurons, glia, and vascular cells. Thus, whereas neurons and glia generate the signals initiating the vasodilation, endothelial cells, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells act in concert to transduce these signals into carefully orchestrated vascular changes that lead to CBF increases focused to the activated area and temporally linked to the period of activation. Neurovascular coupling is disrupted in pathological conditions, such as hypertension, Alzheimer disease, and ischemic stroke. Consequently, CBF is no longer matched to the metabolic requirements of the tissue. This cerebrovascular dysregulation is mediated in large part by the deleterious action of reactive oxygen species on cerebral blood vessels. A major source of cerebral vascular radicals in models of hypertension and Alzheimer disease is the enzyme NADPH oxidase. These findings, collectively, highlight the importance of neurovascular coupling to the health of the normal brain and suggest a therapeutic target for improving brain function in pathologies associated with cerebrovascular dysfunction.},

abstract = {Astroglia from the postnatal cerebral cortex can be reprogrammed in vitro to generate neurons following forced expression of neurogenic transcription factors, thus opening new avenues towards a potential use of endogenous astroglia for brain repair. However, in previous attempts astroglia-derived neurons failed to establish functional synapses, a severe limitation towards functional neurogenesis. It remained therefore also unknown whether neurons derived from reprogrammed astroglia could be directed towards distinct neuronal subtype identities by selective expression of distinct neurogenic fate determinants. Here we show that strong and persistent expression of neurogenic fate determinants driven by silencing-resistant retroviral vectors instructs astroglia from the postnatal cortex in vitro to mature into fully functional, synapse-forming neurons. Importantly, the neurotransmitter fate choice of astroglia-derived neurons can be controlled by selective expression of distinct neurogenic transcription factors: forced expression of the dorsal telencephalic fate determinant neurogenin-2 (Neurog2) directs cortical astroglia to generate synapse-forming glutamatergic neurons; in contrast, the ventral telencephalic fate determinant Dlx2 induces a GABAergic identity, although the overall efficiency of Dlx2-mediated neuronal reprogramming is much lower compared to Neurog2, suggesting that cortical astroglia possess a higher competence to respond to the dorsal telencephalic fate determinant. Interestingly, however, reprogramming of astroglia towards the generation of GABAergic neurons was greatly facilitated when the astroglial cells were first expanded as neurosphere cells prior to transduction with Dlx2. Importantly, this approach of expansion under neurosphere conditions and subsequent reprogramming with distinct neurogenic transcription factors can also be extended to reactive astroglia isolated from the adult injured cerebral cortex, allowing for the selective generation of glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. These data provide evidence that cortical astroglia can undergo a conversion across cell lineages by forced expression of a single neurogenic transcription factor, stably generating fully differentiated neurons. Moreover, neuronal reprogramming of astroglia is not restricted to postnatal stages but can also be achieved from terminally differentiated astroglia of the adult cerebral cortex following injury-induced reactivation.},

@article{Lebon2002,
abstract = {Increasing evidence supports a crucial role for glial metabolism in maintaining proper synaptic function and in the etiology of neurological disease. However, the study of glial metabolism in humans has been hampered by the lack of noninvasive methods. To specifically measure the contribution of astroglia to brain energy metabolism in humans, we used a novel noninvasive nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic approach. We measured carbon 13 incorporation into brain glutamate and glutamine in eight volunteers during an intravenous infusion of [2-13C] acetate, which has been shown in animal models to be metabolized specifically in astroglia. Mathematical modeling of the three established pathways for neurotransmitter glutamate repletion indicates that the glutamate/glutamine neurotransmitter cycle between astroglia and neurons (0.32 +/- 0.07 micromol x gm(-1) x min(-1)) is the major pathway for neuronal glutamate repletion and that the astroglial TCA cycle flux (0.14 +/- 0.06 micromol x gm(-1) x min(-1)) accounts for approximately 14\% of brain oxygen consumption. Up to 30\% of the glutamine transferred to the neurons by the cycle may derive from replacement of oxidized glutamate by anaplerosis. The further application of this approach could potentially enlighten the role of astroglia in supporting brain glutamatergic activity and in neurological and psychiatric disease.},

@article{Filosa2004,
abstract = {Neuronal activity in the brain is thought to be coupled to cerebral arterioles (functional hyperemia) through Ca2+ signals in astrocytes. Although functional hyperemia occurs rapidly, within seconds, such rapid signaling has not been demonstrated in situ, and Ca2+ measurements in parenchymal arterioles are still lacking. Using a laser scanning confocal microscope and fluorescence Ca2+ indicators, we provide the first evidence that in a brain slice preparation, increased neuronal activity by electrical stimulation (ES) is rapidly signaled, within seconds, to cerebral arterioles and is associated with astrocytic Ca2+ waves. Smooth muscle cells in parenchymal arterioles exhibited Ca2+ and diameter oscillations ("vasomotion") that were rapidly suppressed by ES. The neuronal-mediated Ca2+ rise in cortical astrocytes was dependent on intracellular (inositol trisphosphate [IP3]) and extracellular voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel sources. The Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin prevented the rise in astrocytic [Ca2+]i and the suppression of Ca2+ oscillations in parenchymal arterioles to ES, indicating that neuronal activity was necessary for both events. Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors in astrocytes significantly decreased the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations in parenchymal arterioles. This study supports the concept that astrocytic Ca2+ changes signal the cerebral microvasculature and indicate the novel concept that this communication occurs through the suppression of arteriolar [Ca2+]i oscillations and corresponding vasomotion.

abstract = {Neurovascular coupling is the well-documented link between neural stimulation and constriction or dilation of the surrounding vasculature. Glial cells mediate this response via their unique anatomy, which connects neurons to arterioles. It is believed that calcium transients and the release of secondary messengers by these cells influence the vascular response. We present a model of intracellular calcium dynamics in an astrocyte (glial cell) and show that stable oscillatory behaviour is possible under certain conditions. We then couple this to a novel model for the relationship between calcium concentration and the production of vasoactive secondary messengers through a fatty-acid intermediate. The two secondary messengers modelled are epoxyeicosatrienoic and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (EET and 20-HETE, respectively). These secondary messengers are produced on different time scales, and we show how this supports the observation that the vasculature dilates rapidly in response to neural stimulation, before returning to baseline levels on a slower time scale.},

@article{Dormanns2014,
abstract = {A numerical model of neurovascular coupling (NVC) is presented based on neuronal activity coupled to vasodilation/contraction models via the astrocytic mediated perivascular K(+) and the smooth muscle cell Ca(2+) pathway. Luminal agonists acting on P2Y receptors on the endothelial cell surface provide a flux of IP3 into the endothelial cytosol. This concentration of IP3 is transported via gap junctions between endothelial and smooth muscle cells providing a source of sacroplasmic derived Ca(2+) in the smooth muscle cell. The model is able to relate a neuronal input signal to the corresponding vessel reaction. Results indicate that blood flow mediated IP3 production via the agonist ATP has a substantial effect on the contraction/dilation dynamics of the SMC. The resulting variation in cytosolic Ca(2+) can enhance and inhibit the flow of blood to the cortical tissue. IP3 coupling between endothelial and smooth muscle cells seems to be important in the dynamics of the smooth muscle cell. The VOCC channels are, due to the hyperpolarisation from K(+) SMC efflux, almost entirely closed and do not seem to play a significant role during neuronal activity. The current model shows that astrocytic Ca(2+) is not necessary for neurovascular coupling to occur in contrast to a number of experiments outlining the importance of astrocytic Ca(2+) in NVC, however this Ca(2+) pathway is not the only one mediating NVC. Importantly agonists in flowing blood have a significant influence on the endothelial and smooth muscle cell dynamics.},

There clearly is still an enormous amount of experimental and theoretical work to be done to unravel the precise mechanism of neurovascular coupling, but over the last decade significant advances have been made. The most recent studies confirm the original finding that the activation of Ca(2+) elevations in astrocyte endfeet is an essential step but also reveal new levels of complexity in the astrocyte control of neurovascular coupling. The recent evidence for a link between Ca(2+) signalling in astrocytes and local metabolic states of the brain tissue has broad implications for the interpretation of data from functional brain imaging studies. Unraveling the full molecular mechanism of the astrocyte control of cerebral blood flow represents a formidable challenge in neurobiological research in the years to come that might also create opportunities for the development of new therapeutic strategies for cerebrovascular diseases such as ischemic stroke, hypertension and migraine as well as neurodegenerative diseases as Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {L-Arginine is the only endogenous nitrogen-containing substrate of NO synthase (NOS), and it thus governs the production of NO during nervous system development as well as in disease states such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and HIV dementia. The "arginine paradox" refers to the dependence of cellular NO production on exogenous L-arginine concentration despite the theoretical saturation of NOS enzymes with intracellular L-arginine. Herein, we report that decreased availability of L-arginine blocked induction of NO production in cytokine-stimulated astrocytes, owing to inhibition of inducible NOS (iNOS) protein expression. However, activity of the promoter of the iNOS gene, induction of iNOS mRNA, and stability of iNOS protein were not inhibited under these conditions. Our results indicate that inhibition of iNOS activity by arginine depletion in stimulated astrocyte cultures occurs via inhibition of translation of iNOS mRNA. After stimulation by cytokines, uptake of L-arginine negatively regulates the phosphorylation status of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF2 alpha), which, in turn, regulates translation of iNOS mRNA. eIF2 alpha phosphorylation correlates with phosphorylation of the mammalian homolog of yeast GCN2 eIF2 alpha kinase. As the kinase activity of GCN2 is activated by phosphorylation, these findings suggest that GCN2 activity represents a proximal step in the iNOS translational regulation by availability of l-arginine. These results provide an explanation for the arginine paradox for iNOS and define a distinct mechanism by which a substrate can regulate the activity of its associated enzyme.},

abstract = {A mathematical and numerical model is developed for the adhesion of platelets in stagnation point flow. The model provides for a correct representation of the axi-symmetric flow and explicitly uses shear rate to characterise not only the convective transport but also the simple surface reaction mechanism used to model platelet adhesion at the wall surface. Excellent agreement exists between the analytical solution and that obtained by the numerical integration of the full Navier--Stokes equations and decoupled conservation of species equations. It has been shown that for a constant wall reaction rate modelling platelet adhesion the maximum platelet flux occurs at the stagnation point streamline. This is in direct contrast to that found in experiment where the maximum platelet deposition occurs at some distance downstream of the stagnation point. However, if the wall reaction rate is chosen to be dependent on the wall shear stress then the analysis shows that the maximum platelet flux occurs downstream of the stagnation point, providing a more realistic model of experimental evidence. The analytical formulation is applicable to a large number of two-dimensional and axi-symmetrical surface reaction flows where the wall shear stress is known a priori.},

abstract = {Pericytes play a key role in the development of cerebral microcirculation. The exact role of pericytes in the neurovascular unit in the adult brain and during brain aging remains, however, elusive. Using adult viable pericyte-deficient mice, we show that pericyte loss leads to brain vascular damage by two parallel pathways: (1) reduction in brain microcirculation causing diminished brain capillary perfusion, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral blood flow responses to brain activation that ultimately mediates chronic perfusion stress and hypoxia, and (2) blood-brain barrier breakdown associated with brain accumulation of serum proteins and several vasculotoxic and/or neurotoxic macromolecules ultimately leading to secondary neuronal degenerative changes. We show that age-dependent vascular damage in pericyte-deficient mice precedes neuronal degenerative changes, learning and memory impairment, and the neuroinflammatory response. Thus, pericytes control key neurovascular functions that are necessary for proper neuronal structure and function, and pericyte loss results in a progressive age-dependent vascular-mediated neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Smooth muscle and endothelial cells in the arterial wall are exposed
to mechanical stress. Indeed blood flow induces intraluminal pressure
variations and shear stress. An increase in pressure may induce a
vessel contraction, a phenomenon known as the myogenic response.
Many muscular vessels present vasomotion, i.e., rhythmic diameter
oscillations caused by synchronous cytosolic calcium oscillations
of the smooth muscle cells. Vasomotion has been shown to be modulated
by pressure changes. To get a better understanding of the effect
of stress and in particular pressure on vasomotion, we propose a
model of a blood vessel describing the calcium dynamics in a coupled
population of smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells and the consequent
vessel diameter variations. We show that a rise in pressure increases
the calcium concentration. This may either induce or abolish vasomotion,
or increase its frequency depending on the initial conditions. In
our model the myogenic response is less pronounced for large arteries
than for small arteries and occurs at higher values of pressure if
the wall thickness is increased. Our results are in agreement with
experimental observations concerning a broad range of vessels.},

abstract = {Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is dually acylated by N-myristoylation and cysteine palmitoylation and resides in Golgi and caveolae membranes. N-Myristoylation is necessary for its membrane association and targeting into the Golgi complex of transfected cells whereas palmitoylation influences the targeting of eNOS into caveolae. However, the in vivo significance of palmitoylation, membrane association, and the corresponding caveolar localization of eNOS have not been shown. To further examine the nature of membrane association of palmitoylation-deficient forms of eNOS and to address the functional role(s) of palmitoylation in activation of eNOS in vivo, HEk 293 cells stably transfected with wild-type (WT) or palmitoylation-deficient mutants of eNOS were generated. Membrane association of the mutants was biochemically similar to that of the WT protein in terms of their resistance to high salt, high pH, and distribution between Triton X-114 detergent and aqueous phases, suggesting that other hydrophobic factor (s) in eNOS most likely contribute to its membrane association. Most importantly, palmitoylation-deficient mutants of eNOS released less NO from the cells than did WT enzyme, suggesting that palmitoylation plays an important role in determining the optimal release of NO from intact cells. The diminished release of NO from the palmitoylation-deficient mutants was not attributable to alterations in its catalytic properties as the purified mutant and WT enzymes were kinetically identical. Since palmitoylation is necessary for localization of eNOS in caveolae, our data suggest that such localization could regulate the frequency and magnitude of NO release in response to stimuli in vivo.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes in midlife or late life increases the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD), and type 1 diabetes has been associated with a higher risk of detrimental cognitive outcomes, although studies from older adults are lacking. We investigated whether individuals with AD were more likely to have a history of diabetes than matched controls from the general aged population.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Information on reimbursed diabetes medication (including both type 1 and 2 diabetes) of all Finnish individuals with reimbursed AD medication in 2005 (n = 28,093) and their AD-free control subjects during 1972-2005 was obtained from a special reimbursement register maintained by the Social Insurance Institute of Finland.

RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes was 11.4\% in the whole study population, 10.7\% (n = 3,012) among control subjects, and 12.0\% (n = 3,372) among AD case subjects. People with AD were more likely to have diabetes than matched control subjects (unadjusted OR 1.14 [95\% CI 1.08-1.20]), even after adjusting for cardiovascular diseases (OR 1.31 [1.22-1.41]). The associations were stronger with diabetes diagnosed at midlife (adjusted OR 1.60 [1.34-1.84] and 1.25 [1.16-1.36] for midlife and late-life diabetes, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with clinically verified AD are more likely to have a history of clinically verified and medically treated diabetes than the general aged population, although the difference is small.},

ICWs are triggered by a variety of stimuli and involve the release of Ca(2+) from internal stores. The propagation of ICWs predominately involves cell communication with internal messengers moving via gap junctions or extracellular messengers mediating paracrine signaling. ICWs appear to be important in both normal physiology as well as pathophysiological processes in a variety of organs and tissues including brain, liver, retina, cochlea, and vascular tissue. We review here the mechanisms of initiation and propagation of ICWs, the key intra- and extracellular messengers (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and ATP) mediating ICWs, and the proposed physiological functions of ICWs.},

@article{Bolz2003,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: NO-induced dilations in resistance arteries (RAs) are not associated with decreases in vascular smooth muscle cell Ca2+. We tested whether a cGMP-dependent activation of the smooth muscle myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) resulting in a Ca2+ desensitization of the contractile apparatus was the underlying mechanism and whether it could be antagonized by the RhoA pathway.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The Ca2+ sensitivity of RA was assessed as the relation between changes in diameter and [Ca2+]i in depolarized RA (120 mol/L K+) exposed to stepwise increases in Ca2+ex (0 to 3 mmol/L). Effects of 10 micromol/L sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on Ca2+ sensitivity were determined before and after application of the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ (1 micromol/L) and the MLCP inhibitor calyculin A (120 nmol/L) and in presence of the RhoA-activating phospholipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P, 12 nmol/L). SNP-induced dilations were also studied in controls and in RAs pretreated with the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 or transfected with a dominant-negative RhoA mutant (N19RhoA). Constrictions elicited by increasing Ca2+ex were significantly attenuated by SNP, which, however, left associated increases in [Ca2+]i unaffected. This NO-induced attenuation was blocked by ODQ, calyculin A, and S1P. The S1P-induced translocation of RhoA indicating activation of the GTPase was not reversed by SNP. Inhibition of RhoA/Rho kinase by N19RhoA or Y27632 significantly augmented SNP-induced dilations.

CONCLUSIONS: NO dilates RA by activating the MLCP in a cGMP-dependent manner, thereby reducing the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus. MLCP inactivation via the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway antagonizes this Ca2+-desensitizing effect that, in turn, can be restored using RhoA/Rho kinase inhibitors.},

abstract = {Astroglia from the postnatal cerebral cortex can be reprogrammed in vitro to generate neurons following forced expression of neurogenic transcription factors, thus opening new avenues towards a potential use of endogenous astroglia for brain repair. However, in previous attempts astroglia-derived neurons failed to establish functional synapses, a severe limitation towards functional neurogenesis. It remained therefore also unknown whether neurons derived from reprogrammed astroglia could be directed towards distinct neuronal subtype identities by selective expression of distinct neurogenic fate determinants. Here we show that strong and persistent expression of neurogenic fate determinants driven by silencing-resistant retroviral vectors instructs astroglia from the postnatal cortex in vitro to mature into fully functional, synapse-forming neurons. Importantly, the neurotransmitter fate choice of astroglia-derived neurons can be controlled by selective expression of distinct neurogenic transcription factors: forced expression of the dorsal telencephalic fate determinant neurogenin-2 (Neurog2) directs cortical astroglia to generate synapse-forming glutamatergic neurons; in contrast, the ventral telencephalic fate determinant Dlx2 induces a GABAergic identity, although the overall efficiency of Dlx2-mediated neuronal reprogramming is much lower compared to Neurog2, suggesting that cortical astroglia possess a higher competence to respond to the dorsal telencephalic fate determinant. Interestingly, however, reprogramming of astroglia towards the generation of GABAergic neurons was greatly facilitated when the astroglial cells were first expanded as neurosphere cells prior to transduction with Dlx2. Importantly, this approach of expansion under neurosphere conditions and subsequent reprogramming with distinct neurogenic transcription factors can also be extended to reactive astroglia isolated from the adult injured cerebral cortex, allowing for the selective generation of glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. These data provide evidence that cortical astroglia can undergo a conversion across cell lineages by forced expression of a single neurogenic transcription factor, stably generating fully differentiated neurons. Moreover, neuronal reprogramming of astroglia is not restricted to postnatal stages but can also be achieved from terminally differentiated astroglia of the adult cerebral cortex following injury-induced reactivation.},

abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a diffusion barrier, which impedes influx of most compounds from blood to brain. Three cellular elements of the brain microvasculature compose the BBB-endothelial cells, astrocyte end-feet, and pericytes (PCs). Tight junctions (TJs), present between the cerebral endothelial cells, form a diffusion barrier, which selectively excludes most blood-borne substances from entering the brain. Astrocytic end-feet tightly ensheath the vessel wall and appear to be critical for the induction and maintenance of the TJ barrier, but astrocytes are not believed to have a barrier function in the mammalian brain. Dysfunction of the BBB, for example, impairment of the TJ seal, complicates a number of neurologic diseases including stroke and neuroinflammatory disorders. We review here the recent developments in our understanding of the BBB and the role of the BBB dysfunction in CNS disease. We have focused on intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in premature infants, which may involve dysfunction of the TJ seal as well as immaturity of the BBB in the germinal matrix (GM). A paucity of TJs or PCs, coupled with incomplete coverage of blood vessels by astrocyte end-feet, may account for the fragility of blood vessels in the GM of premature infants. Finally, this review describes the pathogenesis of increased BBB permeability in hypoxia-ischemia and inflammatory mechanisms involving the BBB in septic encephalopathy, HIV-induced dementia, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer disease.},

abstract = {Brain perfusion is tightly coupled to neuronal activity, is commonly used to monitor normal or pathological brain function, and is a direct reflection of the interactions that occur between neuronal signals and blood vessels. Cerebral blood vessels at the surface and within the brain are surrounded by nerve fibers that originate, respectively, from peripheral nerve ganglia and intrinsic brain neurons. Although of different origin and targeting distinct vascular beds, these "perivascular nerves" fulfill similar roles related to cerebrovascular functions, a major one being to regulate their tone and, therein, brain perfusion. This utmost function, which underlies the signals used in functional neuroimaging techniques and which can be jeopardized in pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and migraine headache, is thus regulated at several levels. Recently, new insights into our understanding of how neural input regulate cerebrovascular tone resulted in the rediscovery of the functional "neurovascular unit." These remarkable advances suggest that neuron-driven changes in vascular tone result from interactions that involve all components of the neurovascular unit, transducing neuronal signals into vasomotor responses not only through direct interaction between neurons and vessels but also indirectly via the perivascular astrocytes. Neurovascular coupling is thus determined by chemical signals released from activated perivascular nerves and astrocytes that alter vascular tone to locally adjust perfusion to the spatial and temporal changes in brain activity.},

abstract = {Free nitric oxide (NO) activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), an enzyme, within both pulmonary and vascular smooth muscle. sGC catalyzes the cyclization of guanosine 5'-triphosphate to guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP). Binding rates of NO to the ferrous heme(s) of sGC have been measured in vitro. However, a missing link in our understanding of the control mechanism of sGC by NO is a comprehensive in vivo kinetic analysis. Available literature data suggests that NO dissociation from the heme center of sGC is accelerated by its interaction with one or more cofactors in vivo. We present a working model for sGC activation and NO consumption in vivo. Our model predicts that NO influences the cGMP formation rate over a concentration range of approximately 5-100 nM (apparent Michaelis constant approximately 23 nM), with Hill coefficients between 1.1 and 1.5. The apparent reaction order for NO consumption by sGC is dependent on NO concentration, and varies between 0 and 1.5. Finally, the activation of sGC (half-life approximately 1-2 s) is much more rapid than deactivation (approximately 50 s). We conclude that control of sGC in vivo is most likely ultra-sensitive, and that activation in vivo occurs at lower NO concentrations than previously reported.},

Are these cells only filling up the space and passively nurturing the neurons, or do they also contribute to information transfer and processing? After several years of intense research since the pioneer discovery of astrocytic calcium waves and glutamate release onto neurons in vitro, the neuronal-glial studies have answered many questions thanks to technological advances. However, the definitive in vivo role of astrocytes remains to be addressed. In addition, it is becoming clear that diverse populations of astrocytes coexist with different molecular identities and specialized functions adjusted to their microenvironment, but do they all belong to the umbrella family of astrocytes? One population of astrocytes takes on a new function by displaying both support cell and stem cell characteristics in the neurogenic niches. Here, we define characteristics that classify a cell as an astrocyte under physiological conditions. We will also discuss the well-established and emerging functions of astrocytes with an emphasis on their roles on neuronal activity and as neural stem cells in adult neurogenic zones.},

abstract = {Increasing evidence supports a crucial role for glial metabolism in maintaining proper synaptic function and in the etiology of neurological disease. However, the study of glial metabolism in humans has been hampered by the lack of noninvasive methods. To specifically measure the contribution of astroglia to brain energy metabolism in humans, we used a novel noninvasive nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic approach. We measured carbon 13 incorporation into brain glutamate and glutamine in eight volunteers during an intravenous infusion of [2-13C] acetate, which has been shown in animal models to be metabolized specifically in astroglia. Mathematical modeling of the three established pathways for neurotransmitter glutamate repletion indicates that the glutamate/glutamine neurotransmitter cycle between astroglia and neurons (0.32 +/- 0.07 micromol x gm(-1) x min(-1)) is the major pathway for neuronal glutamate repletion and that the astroglial TCA cycle flux (0.14 +/- 0.06 micromol x gm(-1) x min(-1)) accounts for approximately 14\% of brain oxygen consumption. Up to 30\% of the glutamine transferred to the neurons by the cycle may derive from replacement of oxidized glutamate by anaplerosis. The further application of this approach could potentially enlighten the role of astroglia in supporting brain glutamatergic activity and in neurological and psychiatric disease.},

Here, I propose the neurovascular hypothesis of AD, suggesting that faulty clearance of amyloid beta peptide (A beta) across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), aberrant angiogenesis and senescence of the cerebrovascular system could initiate neurovascular uncoupling, vessel regression, brain hypoperfusion and neurovascular inflammation. Ultimately, this would lead to BBB compromise, to chemical imbalance in the neuronal environment and to synaptic and neuronal dysfunction, injury and loss. Based on the neurovascular hypothesis, I suggest an array of new potential therapeutic approaches that could be developed for AD, to enhance A beta clearance and neurovascular repair, and to protect the neurovascular unit from divergent inducers of injury and apoptosis.},

abstract = {The mechanisms by which active neurons, via astrocytes, rapidly signal
intracerebral arterioles to dilate remain obscure. Here we show that
modest elevation of extracellular potassium (K+) activated inward
rectifier K+ (Kir) channels and caused membrane potential hyperpolarization
in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of intracerebral arterioles and, in
cortical brain slices, induced Kir-dependent vasodilation and suppression
of SMC intracellular calcium (Ca2+) oscillations. Neuronal activation
induced a rapid (<2 s latency) vasodilation that was greatly reduced
by Kir channel blockade and completely abrogated by concurrent cyclooxygenase
inhibition. Astrocytic endfeet exhibited large-conductance, Ca2+-sensitive
K+ (BK) channel currents that could be activated by neuronal stimulation.
Blocking BK channels or ablating the gene encoding these channels
prevented neuronally induced vasodilation and suppression of arteriolar
SMC Ca2+, without affecting the astrocytic Ca2+ elevation. These
results support the concept of intercellular K+ channel-to-K+ channel
signaling, through which neuronal activity in the form of an astrocytic
Ca2+ signal is decoded by astrocytic BK channels, which locally release
K+ into the perivascular space to activate SMC Kir channels and cause
vasodilation.},

Many studies reporting astrocyte-driven neuronal activity have evoked astrocyte Ca(2+) increases by application of endogenous ligands that directly activate neuronal receptors, making astrocyte contribution to neuronal effect(s) difficult to determine. We have made transgenic mice that express a Gq-coupled receptor only in astrocytes to evoke astrocyte Ca(2+) increases using an agonist that does not bind endogenous receptors in brain. By recording from CA1 pyramidal cells in acute hippocampal slices from these mice, we demonstrate that widespread Ca(2+) elevations in 80\%-90\% of stratum radiatum astrocytes do not increase neuronal Ca(2+), produce neuronal slow inward currents, or affect excitatory synaptic activity. Our findings call into question the developing consensus that Ca(2+)-dependent glutamate release by astrocytes directly affects neuronal synaptic activity in situ.},

abstract = {Brain perfusion is tightly coupled to neuronal activity, is commonly used to monitor normal or pathological brain function, and is a direct reflection of the interactions that occur between neuronal signals and blood vessels. Cerebral blood vessels at the surface and within the brain are surrounded by nerve fibers that originate, respectively, from peripheral nerve ganglia and intrinsic brain neurons. Although of different origin and targeting distinct vascular beds, these "perivascular nerves" fulfill similar roles related to cerebrovascular functions, a major one being to regulate their tone and, therein, brain perfusion. This utmost function, which underlies the signals used in functional neuroimaging techniques and which can be jeopardized in pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and migraine headache, is thus regulated at several levels. Recently, new insights into our understanding of how neural input regulate cerebrovascular tone resulted in the rediscovery of the functional "neurovascular unit." These remarkable advances suggest that neuron-driven changes in vascular tone result from interactions that involve all components of the neurovascular unit, transducing neuronal signals into vasomotor responses not only through direct interaction between neurons and vessels but also indirectly via the perivascular astrocytes. Neurovascular coupling is thus determined by chemical signals released from activated perivascular nerves and astrocytes that alter vascular tone to locally adjust perfusion to the spatial and temporal changes in brain activity.},

We say that the parameter vector is feasible if there exists a positive solution to this system. A set of all feasible parameter vectors is called the feasibility set. If all the positive entries are log-convex functions, the paper shows that the associated Perron root is log-convex on the parameter set and the l1-norm of the solution is log-convex on the feasibility set. These results imply that the feasibility set is a convex set regardless whether the l1-norm of the solution is bounded by some positive real number or not. Finally, we show important applications of these results to wireless communication networks and prove some other interesting results for this special case.},

abstract = {Fluid shear stress activates the endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) by a mechanism which does not require an increase in the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), and is sensitive to several kinase inhibitors. Although phosphorylation of eNOS has been suggested to regulate enzyme activity, the mechanism of eNOS activation is still unclear. Here we demonstrate that fluid shear stress elicits the phosphorylation of eNOS on tyrosine and serine residues. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), using wortmannin or a dominant negative mutant of its downstream target, Akt (protein kinase B), prevented the maintained serine phosphorylation and activation of eNOS. Enhancing eNOS phosphorylation by inhibiting serine/threonine phosphatases, increased eNOS activity by approximately twofold, as assessed by the accumulation of intracellular cyclic GMP, without increasing the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+. These data suggest that shear stress activates a pathway involving PI3K and the serine/threonine kinase Akt, which phosphorylates eNOS. This phosphorylation directly increases eNOS activity at resting [Ca2+]i, thus rendering the shear stress-induced activation of eNOS apparently Ca2+-independent.},

abstract = {Astrocytes were the original neuroglia of Ram\'{o}n y Cajal but after 100 years there is no satisfactory definition of what should comprise this class of cells. This essay takes a historical and philosophical approach to the question of astrocytic identity. The classic approach of identification by morphology and location are too limited to determine new members of the astrocyte population. I also critically evaluate the use of protein markers measured by immunoreactivity, as well as the newer technique of marking living cells by using promoters for these same proteins to drive reporter genes. These two latter approaches have yielded an expanded population of astrocytes with diverse functions, but also mark cells that traditionally would not be defined as astrocytes. Thus we need a combination of measures to define an astrocyte but it is not clear what this combination should be. The molecular approach, especially promoter driven fluorescent reporter genes, does have the advantage of pre marking living astrocytes for electrophysiological or imaging recordings. However, lack of sufficient understanding of the behavior of the inserted constructs has led to unclear results. This approach will no doubt be perfected with time but at present an acceptable, practical definition of what constitutes the class of astrocytes remains elusive.},

abstract = {In spite of intense recent investigation of the physiological and pathophysiological roles of endogenously produced nitric oxide (.NO) in mammalian systems, little quantitative information exists concerning the diffusion of this small nonelectrolyte from its source (NO synthase) to its targets of action. I present here a conceptual framework for analyzing the intracellular and intercellular diffusion and reaction of free .NO, using kinetic modeling and calculations of the diffusibility of .NO and its reactions in aqueous solution based on published data. If the half-life of .NO is greater than approximately 25 msec and the rates of reaction of .NO with its targets are slower than its diffusion or reaction with O2 (for which there is experimental evidence in at least some systems), then (i) .NO acts in vivo in a mostly paracrine fashion for a collection of .NO-producing cells, (ii) .NO diffuses to significant concentrations at distances relatively far removed from a single .NO-producing cell, and (iii) localized sites of vascularization will scavenge .NO (and thus decrease its actions) at distances many cell diameters away from that site. These conclusions have important implications with regard to the mechanism of endothelium-dependent relaxation, the autocrine vs. paracrine actions of .NO, and the role of the spatial relationship between specific sites of .NO formation and neighboring blood vessels in .NO-effected and -affected neuronal signal transmission.},

abstract = {Neural activities trigger regional vasodilation in the brain. Diffusible messengers such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostanoids are considered to work as vasodilators in neurovascular coupling. However, their roles are still controversial. In the present study, cortical images of neural activities and vasodilation were recorded through the intact skull of C57BL/6 mice anesthetized with urethane. Flavoprotein fluorescence responses elicited by vibratory hindpaw stimulation were followed by darkening of arteriole images reflecting vasodilation in the somatosensory cortex. Vasodilation was also observed in light reflection images at the wavelength of 570 nm in the same mice. We perfused the surface of the cortex under the skull with 100 microM N(G)-nitro-l-arginine (l-NA), an inhibitor of NO synthase (NOS), and 10 microM indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX). These drugs suppressed vasodilation without changing flavoprotein fluorescence responses. A mixture of l-NA and indomethacin almost completely eliminated vasodilation. In mice lacking neuronal NOS (nNOS), activity-dependent vasodilation was significantly suppressed compared with that in littermate control mice, while that in mice lacking cytosolic phospholipase A2 alpha (cPLA2alpha) was unchanged. These results indicate that NO works as a vasodilator in neurovascular coupling of the mouse somatosensory cortex.},

abstract = {Vascular dysfunction has a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent data from brain imaging studies in humans and animal models suggest that cerebrovascular dysfunction may precede cognitive decline and onset of neurodegenerative changes in AD and AD models. Cerebral hypoperfusion and impaired amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) clearance across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may contribute to the onset and progression of dementia AD type. Decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) negatively affects the synthesis of proteins required for memory and learning, and may eventually lead to neuritic injury and neuronal death. Impaired clearance of Abeta from the brain by the cells of the neurovascular unit may lead to its accumulation on blood vessels and in brain parenchyma. The accumulation of Abeta on the cerebral blood vessels, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is associated with cognitive decline and is one of the hallmarks of AD pathology. CAA can severely disrupt the integrity of the blood vessel wall resulting in micro or macro intracerebral bleedings that exacerbates neurodegenerative process and inflammatory response and may lead to hemorrhagic stroke, respectively. Here, we review the role of the neurovascular unit and molecular mechanisms in vascular cells behind AD and CAA pathogenesis. First, we discuss apparent vascular changes, including the cerebral hypoperfusion and vascular degeneration that contribute to different stages of the disease process in AD individuals. We next discuss the role of the low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP), a key Abeta clearance receptor at the BBB and along the cerebrovascular system, whose expression is suppressed early in AD. We also discuss how brain-derived apolipoprotein E isoforms may influence Abeta clearance across the BBB. We then review the role of two interacting transcription factors, myocardin and serum response factor, in cerebral vascular cells in controlling CBF responses and LRP-mediated Abeta clearance. Finally, we discuss the role of microglia and perivascular macrophages in Abeta clearance from the brain. The data reviewed here support an essential role of neurovascular and BBB mechanisms in contributing to both, onset and progression of AD.},

abstract = {The nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP pathway in the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) is an important cellular signaling system for the regulation of VSMC relaxation. We present a mathematical model to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this pathway. The model describes the flow of NO-driven signal transduction: NO activation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), sGC- and phosphodiesterase-catalyzed cGMP production and degradation, cGMP-mediated regulation of protein targets including the Ca2+-activated K+ (KCa) channel, and the myosin contractile system. Model simulations reproduce major NO/cGMP-induced VSMC relaxation effects, including intracellular Ca2+ concentration reduction and Ca2+ desensitization of myosin phosphorylation and force generation. Using the model, we examine several testable principles. 1) Rapid sGC desensitization is caused by end-product cGMP feedback inhibition; a large fraction of the steady-state sGC population is in an inactivated intermediate state, and cGMP production is limited well below maximum. 2) NO activates the K(Ca) channel with both cGMP-dependent and -independent mechanisms; moderate NO concentration affects the K(Ca) via the cGMP-dependent pathway, whereas higher NO concentration is accommodated by a cGMP-independent mechanism. 3) Chronic NO synthase inhibition may cause underexpressions of K+ channels including inward rectifier and K(Ca) channels. 4) Ca2+ desensitization of the contractile system is distinguished from Ca2+ sensitivity of myosin phosphorylation. The model integrates these interactions among the heterogeneous components of the NO signaling system and can serve as a general modeling framework for studying NO-mediated VSMC relaxation under various physiological and pathological conditions. New data can be readily incorporated into this framework for interpretation and possible modification and improvement of the model.},

In addition, it is becoming clear that diverse populations of astrocytes coexist with different molecular identities and specialized functions adjusted to their microenvironment, but do they all belong to the umbrella family of astrocytes? One population of astrocytes takes on a new function by displaying both support cell and stem cell characteristics in the neurogenic niches. Here, we define characteristics that classify a cell as an astrocyte under physiological conditions. We will also discuss the well-established and emerging functions of astrocytes with an emphasis on their roles on neuronal activity and as neural stem cells in adult neurogenic zones.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in autocrine and paracrine manner in numerous physiological processes, including regulation of blood pressure and blood flow, platelet aggregation, and leukocyte adhesion. In vascular wall, most of the bioavailable NO is believed to derive from endothelial cell NO synthase (eNOS). Recently, neuronal NOS (nNOS) has been identified as a source of NO in the vicinity of microvessels and has been shown to participate in vascular function. Thus NO can be produced and transported to the vascular smooth muscle cells from 1). endothelial cells and 2). perivascular nerve fibers, mast cells, and other nNOS-containing sources. In this study, a mathematical model of NO diffusion-reaction in a cylindrical arteriolar segment was formulated. The model quantifies the relative contribution of these NO sources and the smooth muscle availability of NO in a tissue containing an arteriolar blood vessel. The results indicate that a source of NO derived through nNOS in the perivascular region can be a significant contributor to smooth muscle NO. Predicted smooth muscle NO concentrations are as high as 430 nM, which is consistent with reported experimental measurements approximately 400 nM). In addition, we used the model to analyze the smooth muscle NO availability in 1). eNOS and nNOS knockout experiments, 2). the presence of myoglobin, and 3). the presence of cell-free Hb, e.g., Hb-based oxygen carriers. The results show that NO release by nNOS would significantly affect available smooth muscle NO. Further experimental and theoretical studies are required to account for distribution of NOS isoforms and determine NO availability in vasculatures of different tissues.},

abstract = {In the past two decades, over 1000 clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a benefit in treating stroke, with the exception of thrombolytics. Although many targets have been pursued, including antioxidants, calcium channel blockers, glutamate receptor blockers, and neurotrophic factors, often the focus has been on neuronal mechanisms of injury. Broader attention to loss and dysfunction of non-neuronal cell types is now required to increase the chance of success. Of the several glial cell types, this review will focus on astrocytes. Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the higher mammalian nervous system, and they play key roles in normal CNS physiology and in central nervous system injury and pathology. In the setting of ischemia astrocytes perform multiple functions, some beneficial and some potentially detrimental, making them excellent candidates as therapeutic targets to improve outcome following stroke and in other central nervous system injuries. The older neurocentric view of the central nervous system has changed radically with the growing understanding of the many essential functions of astrocytes. These include K+ buffering, glutamate clearance, brain antioxidant defense, close metabolic coupling with neurons, and modulation of neuronal excitability. In this review, we will focus on those functions of astrocytes that can both protect and endanger neurons, and discuss how manipulating these functions provides a novel and important strategy to enhance neuronal survival and improve outcome following cerebral ischemia.},

abstract = {It is has been suggested that decreased production of the vasodilatory and anti-aggregative substance NO (nitric oxide) may result in lower cerebral blood flow (CBF) in injured areas of the traumatized brain. The NO-precursor l-arginine has been shown to counteract CBF decreases early after trauma, but microcirculatory and more long-term effects on CBF of l-arginine have not been investigated. In an attempt to analyze effects of l-arginine on the microcirculation in the traumatized brain, the present study was designed to evaluate the effects of l-arginine compared to vehicle (0.9\% saline) following a standardized controlled cortical-impact brain trauma in mice. Cerebral blood flow (autoradiography [14C]-iodoantipyrine), number of perfused capillaries (FITC-dextran fluorescence technique), brain water content (wet vs. dry weight) and the blood to brain transfer constant Ki for [51Cr]-EDTA were analyzed in the injured and the contralateral cortex. Cortical blood flow in the injured cortex was 0.43 ?? 0.3??mL/g/min and 0.81 ?? 0.3??mL/g/min 3??h after trauma in the vehicle and l-arginine groups, respectively (p < 0.05), and no treatment effect was seen 24??h after trauma. The number of perfused capillaries decreased following trauma and was unaffected by l-arginine. Ki increased following trauma and was unaffected by l-arginine. Brain water content was lower in the l-arginine group than in the vehicle group 3??h after trauma and there was no difference between the groups 24??h after trauma. We conclude that l-arginine reduces brain edema formation and improves cortical blood flow in the early phase after a brain trauma, whereas no circulatory effects can be seen after prolonged treatment. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, to investigate the pathophysiological interaction between these diseases, we generated animal models that reflect the pathologic conditions of both diseases. We crossed Alzheimer transgenic mice (APP23) with two types of diabetic mice (ob/ob and NSY mice), and analyzed their metabolic and brain pathology. The onset of diabetes exacerbated Alzheimer-like cognitive dysfunction without an increase in brain amyloid-beta burden in double-mutant (APP(+)-ob/ob) mice. Notably, APP(+)-ob/ob mice showed cerebrovascular inflammation and severe amyloid angiopathy. Conversely, the cross-bred mice showed an accelerated diabetic phenotype compared with ob/ob mice, suggesting that Alzheimer amyloid pathology could aggravate diabetes. Similarly, APP(+)-NSY fusion mice showed more severe glucose intolerance compared with diabetic NSY mice. Furthermore, high-fat diet feeding induced severe memory deficits in APP(+)-NSY mice without an increase in brain amyloid-beta load. Here, we created Alzheimer mouse models with early onset of cognitive dysfunction. Cerebrovascular changes and alteration in brain insulin signaling might play a pivotal role in this relationship. These findings could provide insights into this intensely debated association.},

@article{Bolz2003,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: NO-induced dilations in resistance arteries (RAs) are not associated with decreases in vascular smooth muscle cell Ca2+. We tested whether a cGMP-dependent activation of the smooth muscle myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) resulting in a Ca2+ desensitization of the contractile apparatus was the underlying mechanism and whether it could be antagonized by the RhoA pathway.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The Ca2+ sensitivity of RA was assessed as the relation between changes in diameter and [Ca2+]i in depolarized RA (120 mol/L K+) exposed to stepwise increases in Ca2+ex (0 to 3 mmol/L). Effects of 10 micromol/L sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on Ca2+ sensitivity were determined before and after application of the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ (1 micromol/L) and the MLCP inhibitor calyculin A (120 nmol/L) and in presence of the RhoA-activating phospholipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P, 12 nmol/L). SNP-induced dilations were also studied in controls and in RAs pretreated with the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 or transfected with a dominant-negative RhoA mutant (N19RhoA). Constrictions elicited by increasing Ca2+ex were significantly attenuated by SNP, which, however, left associated increases in [Ca2+]i unaffected. This NO-induced attenuation was blocked by ODQ, calyculin A, and S1P. The S1P-induced translocation of RhoA indicating activation of the GTPase was not reversed by SNP. Inhibition of RhoA/Rho kinase by N19RhoA or Y27632 significantly augmented SNP-induced dilations.

CONCLUSIONS: NO dilates RA by activating the MLCP in a cGMP-dependent manner, thereby reducing the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus. MLCP inactivation via the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway antagonizes this Ca2+-desensitizing effect that, in turn, can be restored using RhoA/Rho kinase inhibitors.},

abstract = {The temperature distribution and rate of heat transfer across an infinite periodic strip of a honeycomb lattice consisting of conductive segments or links joined at nodes or junctions is discussed. A pristine honeycomb behaves like an isotropic medium whose effective conductivity is independent of the orientation of an applied macroscopic temperature gradient. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to determine the effect of link damage or disruption and lattice deformation due to junction displacement. In the simulations, a specified percentage of randomly distributed links are assigned a conductivity that is lower than that of the undamaged links. The balance equations governing the nodal temperatures at the junctions are solved by iteration subject to a periodicity condition along the strip and the Dirichlet condition along the two infinite edges of the strip. The results illustrate the effect of imperfections on the temperature distribution over the network and document the dependence of the effective conductivity on the percentage and conductivity of the defective links. In the case of nonconductive damaged links, the effective conductivity becomes nearly zero when a critical percentage of links are clipped, in agreement with bond percolation theory. However, the functional form of the number density of possible pathways connecting the lower to the upper edge of the strip predicted by percolation theory differs from that of the effective conductivity. Lattice deformation due to random node displacement has a small effect on the effective conductivity of the network. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {L-Arginine is the only endogenous nitrogen-containing substrate of NO synthase (NOS), and it thus governs the production of NO during nervous system development as well as in disease states such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and HIV dementia. The "arginine paradox" refers to the dependence of cellular NO production on exogenous L-arginine concentration despite the theoretical saturation of NOS enzymes with intracellular L-arginine. Herein, we report that decreased availability of L-arginine blocked induction of NO production in cytokine-stimulated astrocytes, owing to inhibition of inducible NOS (iNOS) protein expression. However, activity of the promoter of the iNOS gene, induction of iNOS mRNA, and stability of iNOS protein were not inhibited under these conditions. Our results indicate that inhibition of iNOS activity by arginine depletion in stimulated astrocyte cultures occurs via inhibition of translation of iNOS mRNA. After stimulation by cytokines, uptake of L-arginine negatively regulates the phosphorylation status of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF2 alpha), which, in turn, regulates translation of iNOS mRNA. eIF2 alpha phosphorylation correlates with phosphorylation of the mammalian homolog of yeast GCN2 eIF2 alpha kinase. As the kinase activity of GCN2 is activated by phosphorylation, these findings suggest that GCN2 activity represents a proximal step in the iNOS translational regulation by availability of l-arginine. These results provide an explanation for the arginine paradox for iNOS and define a distinct mechanism by which a substrate can regulate the activity of its associated enzyme.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with a cascade of pathological events involving formation of amyloid-based neuritic plaques and tau-based neurofibrillary tangles, changes in brain structure and function, and eventually, cognitive impairment and functional disability. The precise sequence of when each of these disease markers becomes abnormal is not yet clearly understood. The present study systematically tested the relationship between classes of biomarkers according to a proposed model of temporal sequence by Jack et al. (Lancet Neurology 9:119-128, 2010). We examined temporal relations among four classes of biomarkers: CSF A$\beta$, CSF tau, neuroimaging variables (hippocampal volume, ventricular volume, FDG PET), and cognitive variables (memory and executive function). Random effects modeling of longitudinal data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was used to test hypotheses that putative earlier markers of AD predicted change in later markers, and that intervening markers reduced effects of earlier on later markers. Specifically, we hypothesized that CSF tau would explain CSF A$\beta$'s relation to neuroimaging and cognitive variables, and neuroimaging variables would explain tau's relation to cognitive variables. Consistent with hypotheses, results indicated that CSF A$\beta$ effects on cognition change were substantially attenuated by CSF tau and measures of brain structure and function, and CSF tau effects on cognitive change were attenuated by neuroimaging variables. Contrary to hypotheses, CSF A$\beta$ and CSF tau were observed to have independent effects on neuroimaging and CSF tau had a direct effect on baseline cognition independent of brain structure and function. These results have implications for clarifying the temporal sequence of AD changes and corresponding biomarkers.},

abstract = {S100B is an EF-hand calcium-binding protein that exerts both intracellular and extracellular effects on a variety of cellular processes. The protein is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system by astrocytes, both physiologically and during the course of neurological disease. In the healthy adult brain and during development, constitutive S100B expression acts as a trophic factor to drive neurite extension and to referee neuroplasticity. Yet, when induced during central nervous system disease, the protein can take on maladaptive roles and thereby exacerbate brain pathology. Based on genetic and pharmacological lines of evidence, we consider such deleterious roles of S100B in two common brain pathologies: ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In rodent models of ischemic brain damage, S100B is induced early on during the subacute phase, where it exacerbates gliosis and delayed infarct expansion and thereby worsens functional recovery. In mouse models of AD, S100B drives brain inflammation and gliosis that accelerate cerebral amyloidosis. Pharmacological inhibition of S100B synthesis mitigates hallmark pathologies of both brain diseases, opening the door for translational approaches to treat these devastating neurological disorders.},

abstract = {Research on the biological roles of nitric oxide has revealed that it functions as an important signal and effector molecule in a variety of physiologic and pathologic settings. In animals, nitric oxide is synthesized enzymatically from L-arginine through the actions of the nitric oxide synthases (NOSs). The three known NOS isoforms are all dimeric, bi-domain enzymes that contain iron protoporphyrin IX, flavin adenine dinucleotide, flavin mononucleotide, and tetrahydrobiopterin as bound prosthetic groups. This chapter summarizes information regarding the structure-function aspects of the NOSs, which includes composition of the domains, the protein residues and regions involved in prosthetic group binding, catalytic properties of the domains, the relationship between dimeric structure and prosthetic group binding and function, and factors that control assembly of NOS in cells. A general model for NOS structure and assembly is presented.},

abstract = {Spontaneous contraction and relaxation of arteries (and in some instances venules) has been termed vasomotion and has been observed in an extensive variety of tissues and species. However, its functions and underlying mechanisms are still under discussion. We demonstrate that in vivo spectrophotometry, measured simultaneously with extracellular recordings at the same locations in the visual thalamus of the cat, reveals vasomotion, measured as an oscillation (0.14 hz) in the recorded oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) signal, which appears spontaneously in the microcirculation and can last for periods of hours. During some non-oscillatory periods, maintained sensory stimulation evokes vasomotion lasting \~{}30s, resembling an adaptive vascular phenomenon. This oscillation in the oxyhaemoblobin signal is sensitive to pharmacological manipulation: it is inducible by chloralose anaesthesia and it can be temporarily blocked by systemic administration of adrenaline or acetylcholine (ACh). During these oscillatory periods, neurovascular coupling (i.e. the relationship between local neural activity and the rate of blood supply to that location) appears significantly altered. This raises important questions with regard to the interpretation of results from studies currently dependent upon a linear relationship between neural activity and blood flow, such as neuroimaging.},

abstract = {Administration of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) frequently results in vasoconstriction that is primarily attributed to the scavenging of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) by cell-free hemoglobin. The ensuing pressor response could be caused by the high NO reactivity of HBOC in the vascular lumen and/or the extravasation of hemoglobin molecules. There is a need for quantitative understanding of the NO interaction with HBOC in the blood vessels. We developed a detailed mathematical model of NO diffusion and reaction in the presence of an HBOC for an arteriolar-size vessel. The HBOC reactivity with NO and degree of extravasation was studied in the range of 2-58 x 10(6) M(-1) x s(-1) and 0-100\%, respectively. The model predictions showed that the addition of HBOC reduced the smooth muscle (SM) NO concentration in the activation range (12-28 nM) for soluble guanylate cyclase, a major determinant of SM contraction. The SM NO concentration was significantly reduced when the extravasation of HBOC molecules was considered. The myoglobin present in the parenchymal cells scavenges NO, which reduces the SM NO concentration.},

abstract = {Neuronal activity in the brain is thought to be coupled to cerebral arterioles (functional hyperemia) through Ca2+ signals in astrocytes. Although functional hyperemia occurs rapidly, within seconds, such rapid signaling has not been demonstrated in situ, and Ca2+ measurements in parenchymal arterioles are still lacking. Using a laser scanning confocal microscope and fluorescence Ca2+ indicators, we provide the first evidence that in a brain slice preparation, increased neuronal activity by electrical stimulation (ES) is rapidly signaled, within seconds, to cerebral arterioles and is associated with astrocytic Ca2+ waves. Smooth muscle cells in parenchymal arterioles exhibited Ca2+ and diameter oscillations ("vasomotion") that were rapidly suppressed by ES. The neuronal-mediated Ca2+ rise in cortical astrocytes was dependent on intracellular (inositol trisphosphate [IP3]) and extracellular voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel sources. The Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin prevented the rise in astrocytic [Ca2+]i and the suppression of Ca2+ oscillations in parenchymal arterioles to ES, indicating that neuronal activity was necessary for both events. Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors in astrocytes significantly decreased the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations in parenchymal arterioles. This study supports the concept that astrocytic Ca2+ changes signal the cerebral microvasculature and indicate the novel concept that this communication occurs through the suppression of arteriolar [Ca2+]i oscillations and corresponding vasomotion.

abstract = {It has been postulated that the development of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may result from an imbalance between the generation and clearance of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). Although familial AD appears to be caused by Abeta overproduction, sporadic AD (the most prevalent form) may result from impairment in clearance. Recent evidence suggests that several proteases may contribute to the degradation of Abeta. Furthermore, astrocytes have recently been implicated as a potential cellular mediator of Abeta degradation. In this study, we examined the possibility that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), proteases known to be expressed and secreted by astrocytes, could play a role in extracellular Abeta degradation. We found that astrocytes surrounding amyloid plaques showed enhanced expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in aged amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 mice. Moreover, astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) degraded Abeta, lowering levels and producing several fragments after incubation with synthetic human Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42). This activity was attenuated with specific inhibitors of MMP-2 and -9, as well as in ACM derived from mmp-2 or -9 knock-out (KO) mice. In vivo, significant increases in the steady-state levels of Abeta were found in the brains of mmp-2 and -9 KO mice compared with wild-type controls. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the MMPs with N-[(2R)-2-(hydroxamidocarbonylmethyl)-4-methylpentanoyl]-L-tryptophan methylamide (GM 6001) increased brain interstitial fluid Abeta levels and elimination of half-life in APPsw mice. These results suggest that MMP-2 and -9 may contribute to extracellular brain Abeta clearance by promoting Abeta catabolism.},

abstract = {Pericytes play a key role in the development of cerebral microcirculation. The exact role of pericytes in the neurovascular unit in the adult brain and during brain aging remains, however, elusive. Using adult viable pericyte-deficient mice, we show that pericyte loss leads to brain vascular damage by two parallel pathways: (1) reduction in brain microcirculation causing diminished brain capillary perfusion, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral blood flow responses to brain activation that ultimately mediates chronic perfusion stress and hypoxia, and (2) blood-brain barrier breakdown associated with brain accumulation of serum proteins and several vasculotoxic and/or neurotoxic macromolecules ultimately leading to secondary neuronal degenerative changes. We show that age-dependent vascular damage in pericyte-deficient mice precedes neuronal degenerative changes, learning and memory impairment, and the neuroinflammatory response. Thus, pericytes control key neurovascular functions that are necessary for proper neuronal structure and function, and pericyte loss results in a progressive age-dependent vascular-mediated neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Brain perfusion is tightly coupled to neuronal activity, is commonly used to monitor normal or pathological brain function, and is a direct reflection of the interactions that occur between neuronal signals and blood vessels. Cerebral blood vessels at the surface and within the brain are surrounded by nerve fibers that originate, respectively, from peripheral nerve ganglia and intrinsic brain neurons. Although of different origin and targeting distinct vascular beds, these "perivascular nerves" fulfill similar roles related to cerebrovascular functions, a major one being to regulate their tone and, therein, brain perfusion. This utmost function, which underlies the signals used in functional neuroimaging techniques and which can be jeopardized in pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and migraine headache, is thus regulated at several levels. Recently, new insights into our understanding of how neural input regulate cerebrovascular tone resulted in the rediscovery of the functional "neurovascular unit." These remarkable advances suggest that neuron-driven changes in vascular tone result from interactions that involve all components of the neurovascular unit, transducing neuronal signals into vasomotor responses not only through direct interaction between neurons and vessels but also indirectly via the perivascular astrocytes. Neurovascular coupling is thus determined by chemical signals released from activated perivascular nerves and astrocytes that alter vascular tone to locally adjust perfusion to the spatial and temporal changes in brain activity.},

abstract = {Neural activities trigger regional vasodilation in the brain. Diffusible messengers such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostanoids are considered to work as vasodilators in neurovascular coupling. However, their roles are still controversial. In the present study, cortical images of neural activities and vasodilation were recorded through the intact skull of C57BL/6 mice anesthetized with urethane. Flavoprotein fluorescence responses elicited by vibratory hindpaw stimulation were followed by darkening of arteriole images reflecting vasodilation in the somatosensory cortex. Vasodilation was also observed in light reflection images at the wavelength of 570 nm in the same mice. We perfused the surface of the cortex under the skull with 100 microM N(G)-nitro-l-arginine (l-NA), an inhibitor of NO synthase (NOS), and 10 microM indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX). These drugs suppressed vasodilation without changing flavoprotein fluorescence responses. A mixture of l-NA and indomethacin almost completely eliminated vasodilation. In mice lacking neuronal NOS (nNOS), activity-dependent vasodilation was significantly suppressed compared with that in littermate control mice, while that in mice lacking cytosolic phospholipase A2 alpha (cPLA2alpha) was unchanged. These results indicate that NO works as a vasodilator in neurovascular coupling of the mouse somatosensory cortex.},

abstract = {Large-conductance Ca-activated potassium channels (BK channels) are uniquely sensitive to both membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+. Recent work has demonstrated that in the gating of these channels there are voltage-sensitive steps that are separate from Ca2+ binding steps. Based on this result and the macroscopic steady state and kinetic properties of the cloned BK channel mslo, we have recently proposed a general kinetic scheme to describe the interaction between voltage and Ca2+ in the gating of the mslo channel (Cui, J., D.H. Cox, and R.W. Aldrich. 1997. J. Gen. Physiol. In press.). This scheme supposes that the channel exists in two main conformations, closed and open. The conformational change between closed and open is voltage dependent. Ca2+ binds to both the closed and open conformations, but on average binds more tightly to the open conformation and thereby promotes channel opening. Here we describe the basic properties of models of this form and test their ability to mimic mslo macroscopic steady state and kinetic behavior. The simplest form of this scheme corresponds to a voltage-dependent version of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model of allosteric proteins. The success of voltage-dependent MWC models in describing many aspects of mslo gating suggests that these channels may share a common molecular mechanism with other allosteric proteins whose behaviors have been modeled using the MWC formalism. We also demonstrate how this scheme can arise as a simplification of a more complex scheme that is based on the premise that the channel is a homotetramer with a single Ca2+ binding site and a single voltage sensor in each subunit. Aspects of the mslo data not well fitted by the simplified scheme will likely be better accounted for by this more general scheme. The kinetic schemes discussed in this paper may be useful in interpreting the effects of BK channel modifications or mutations.},

abstract = {Astrocytes are critical regulators of neural and neurovascular network communication. Potassium transport is a central mechanism behind their many functions. Astrocytes encircle synapses with their distal processes, which express two potassium pumps (Na-K and NKCC) and an inward rectifying potassium channel (Kir), whereas the vessel-adjacent endfeet express Kir and BK potassium channels. We provide a detailed model of potassium flow throughout the neurovascular unit (synaptic region, astrocytes, and arteriole) for the cortex of the young brain. Our model reproduces several phenomena observed experimentally: functional hyperemia, in which neural activity triggers astrocytic potassium release at the perivascular endfoot, inducing arteriole dilation; K+ undershoot in the synaptic space after periods of neural activity; neurally induced astrocyte hyperpolarization during Kir blockade. Our results suggest that the dynamics of the vascular response during functional hyperemia are governed by astrocytic Kir for the fast onset and astrocytic BK for maintaining dilation. The model supports the hypothesis that K+ undershoot is caused by excessive astrocytic uptake through Na-K and NKCC pumps, whereas the effect is balanced by Kir. We address parametric uncertainty using high-dimensional stochastic sensitivity analysis and identify possible model limitations. ?? 2013 Biophysical Society.},

@article{Reneman2008,
abstract = {Based upon theory, wall shear stress (WSS), an important determinant of endothelial function and gene expression, has been assumed to be constant along the arterial tree and the same in a particular artery across species. In vivo measurements of WSS, however, have shown that these assumptions are far from valid. In this survey we will discuss the assessment of WSS in the arterial system in vivo and present the results obtained in large arteries and arterioles. In vivo WSS can be estimated from wall shear rate, as derived from non-invasively recorded velocity profiles, and whole blood viscosity in large arteries and plasma viscosity in arterioles, avoiding theoretical assumptions. In large arteries velocity profiles can be recorded by means of a specially designed ultrasound system and in arterioles via optical techniques using fluorescent flow velocity tracers. It is shown that in humans mean WSS is substantially higher in the carotid artery (1.1-1.3 Pa) than in the brachial (0.4-0.5 Pa) and femoral (0.3-0.5 Pa) arteries. Also in animals mean WSS varies substantially along the arterial tree. Mean WSS in arterioles varies between about 1.0 and 5.0 Pa in the various studies and is dependent on the site of measurement in these vessels. Across species mean WSS in a particular artery decreases linearly with body mass, e.g., in the infra-renal aorta from 8.8 Pa in mice to 0.5 Pa in humans. The observation that mean WSS is far from constant along the arterial tree implies that Murray's cube law on flow-diameter relations cannot be applied to the whole arterial system. Because blood flow velocity is not constant along the arterial tree either, a square law also does not hold. The exponent in the power law likely varies along the arterial system, probably from 2 in large arteries near the heart to 3 in arterioles. The in vivo findings also imply that in in vitro studies no average shear stress value can be taken to study effects on endothelial cells derived from different vascular areas or from the same artery in different species. The cells have to be studied under the shear stress conditions they are exposed to in real life.},

abstract = {Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is dually acylated by N-myristoylation and cysteine palmitoylation and resides in Golgi and caveolae membranes. N-Myristoylation is necessary for its membrane association and targeting into the Golgi complex of transfected cells whereas palmitoylation influences the targeting of eNOS into caveolae. However, the in vivo significance of palmitoylation, membrane association, and the corresponding caveolar localization of eNOS have not been shown. To further examine the nature of membrane association of palmitoylation-deficient forms of eNOS and to address the functional role(s) of palmitoylation in activation of eNOS in vivo, HEk 293 cells stably transfected with wild-type (WT) or palmitoylation-deficient mutants of eNOS were generated. Membrane association of the mutants was biochemically similar to that of the WT protein in terms of their resistance to high salt, high pH, and distribution between Triton X-114 detergent and aqueous phases, suggesting that other hydrophobic factor (s) in eNOS most likely contribute to its membrane association. Most importantly, palmitoylation-deficient mutants of eNOS released less NO from the cells than did WT enzyme, suggesting that palmitoylation plays an important role in determining the optimal release of NO from intact cells. The diminished release of NO from the palmitoylation-deficient mutants was not attributable to alterations in its catalytic properties as the purified mutant and WT enzymes were kinetically identical. Since palmitoylation is necessary for localization of eNOS in caveolae, our data suggest that such localization could regulate the frequency and magnitude of NO release in response to stimuli in vivo.},

abstract = {S100B is an EF-hand calcium-binding protein that exerts both intracellular and extracellular effects on a variety of cellular processes. The protein is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system by astrocytes, both physiologically and during the course of neurological disease. In the healthy adult brain and during development, constitutive S100B expression acts as a trophic factor to drive neurite extension and to referee neuroplasticity. Yet, when induced during central nervous system disease, the protein can take on maladaptive roles and thereby exacerbate brain pathology. Based on genetic and pharmacological lines of evidence, we consider such deleterious roles of S100B in two common brain pathologies: ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In rodent models of ischemic brain damage, S100B is induced early on during the subacute phase, where it exacerbates gliosis and delayed infarct expansion and thereby worsens functional recovery. In mouse models of AD, S100B drives brain inflammation and gliosis that accelerate cerebral amyloidosis. Pharmacological inhibition of S100B synthesis mitigates hallmark pathologies of both brain diseases, opening the door for translational approaches to treat these devastating neurological disorders.},

abstract = {Shear stress stimulates nitric oxide (NO) production by phosphorylating endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) at Ser(1179) in a phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)- and protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent manner. The eNOS has additional potential phosphorylation sites, including Ser(116), Thr(497), and Ser(635). Here, we studied these potential phosphorylation sites in response to shear, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and 8-bromocAMP (8-BRcAMP) in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). All three stimuli induced phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser(635), which was consistently slower than that at Ser(1179). Thr(497) was rapidly dephosphorylated by 8-BRcAMP but not by shear and VEGF. None of the stimuli phosphorylated Ser(116). Whereas shear-stimulated Ser(635) phosphorylation was not affected by phosphoinositide-3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY-294002, it was blocked by either treating the cells with a PKA inhibitor H89 or infecting them with a recombinant adenovirus-expressing PKA inhibitor. These results suggest that shear stress stimulates eNOS by two different mechanisms: 1) PKA- and PI3K-dependent and 2) PKA-dependent but PI3K-independent pathways. Phosphorylation of Ser(635) may play an important role in chronic regulation of eNOS in response to mechanical and humoral stimuli.},

abstract = {Astrocytes are considered the third component of the synapse, responding to neurotransmitter release from synaptic terminals and releasing gliotransmitters--including glutamate--in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner to affect neuronal synaptic activity. Many studies reporting astrocyte-driven neuronal activity have evoked astrocyte Ca(2+) increases by application of endogenous ligands that directly activate neuronal receptors, making astrocyte contribution to neuronal effect(s) difficult to determine. We have made transgenic mice that express a Gq-coupled receptor only in astrocytes to evoke astrocyte Ca(2+) increases using an agonist that does not bind endogenous receptors in brain. By recording from CA1 pyramidal cells in acute hippocampal slices from these mice, we demonstrate that widespread Ca(2+) elevations in 80\%-90\% of stratum radiatum astrocytes do not increase neuronal Ca(2+), produce neuronal slow inward currents, or affect excitatory synaptic activity. Our findings call into question the developing consensus that Ca(2+)-dependent glutamate release by astrocytes directly affects neuronal synaptic activity in situ.},

abstract = {Neuronal activity evokes localized changes in blood flow. Although this response, termed neurovascular coupling, is widely used to monitor human brain function and diagnose pathology, the cellular mechanisms that mediate the response remain unclear. We investigated the contribution of glial cells to neurovascular coupling in the acutely isolated mammalian retina. We found that light stimulation and glial cell stimulation can both evoke dilation or constriction of arterioles. Light-evoked and glial-evoked vasodilations were blocked by inhibitors of cytochrome P450 epoxygenase, the synthetic enzyme for epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. Vasoconstrictions, in contrast, were blocked by an inhibitor of omega-hydroxylase, which synthesizes 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Nitric oxide influenced whether vasodilations or vasoconstrictions were produced in response to light and glial stimulation. Light-evoked vasoactivity was blocked when neuron-to-glia signaling was interrupted by a purinergic antagonist. These results indicate that glial cells contribute to neurovascular coupling and suggest that regulation of blood flow may involve both vasodilating and vasoconstricting components.},

abstract = {Cerebral autoregulation (CA) is an most important mechanism responsible for the relatively constant blood flow supply to brain when cerebral perfusion pressure varies. Its assessment in nonacute cases has been relied on the quantification of the relationship between noninvasive beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) and blood flow velocity (BFV). To overcome the nonstationary nature of physiological signals such as BP and BFV, a computational method called multimodal pressure-flow (MMPF) analysis was recently developed to study the nonlinear BP-BFV relationship during the Valsalva maneuver (VM). The present study aimed to determine (i) whether this method can estimate autoregulation from spontaneous BP and BFV fluctuations during baseline rest conditions; (ii) whether there is any difference between the MMPF measures of autoregulation based on intra-arterial BP (ABP) and based on cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP); and (iii) whether the MMPF method provides reproducible and reliable measure for noninvasive assessment of autoregulation. To achieve these aims, we analyzed data from existing databases including: (i) ABP and BFV of 12 healthy control, 10 hypertensive, and 10 stroke subjects during baseline resting conditions and during the Valsalva maneuver, and (ii) ABP, CPP, and BFV of 30 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who were being paralyzed, sedated, and ventilated. We showed that autoregulation in healthy control subjects can be characterized by specific phase shifts between BP and BFV oscillations during the Valsalva maneuver, and the BP-BFV phase shifts were reduced in hypertensive and stroke subjects (P < 0.01), indicating impaired autoregulation. Similar results were found during baseline condition from spontaneous BP and BFV oscillations. The BP-BFV phase shifts obtained during baseline and during VM were highly correlated (R > 0.8, P < 0.0001), showing no statistical difference (paired-t test P > 0.47). In TBI patients there were strong correlations between phases of ABP and CPP oscillations (R = 0.99, P < 0.0001) and, thus, between ABP-BFV and CPP-BFV phase shifts (P < 0.0001, R = 0.76). By repeating the MMPF 4 times on data of TBI subjects, each time on a selected cycle of spontaneous BP and BFV oscillations, we showed that MMPF had better reproducibility than traditional autoregulation index. These results indicate that the MMPF method, based on instantaneous phase relationships between cerebral blood flow velocity and peripheral blood pressure, has better performance than the traditional standard method, and can reliably assess cerebral autoregulation dynamics from ambulatory blood pressure and cerebral blood flow during supine rest conditions.},

In the CNS, nitric oxide has an array of functions, such as the regulation of synaptic plasticity, the sleep-wake cycle and hormone secretion. Particularly interesting is the role of nitric oxide as a Janus molecule in the cell death or survival mechanisms in brain cells. In fact, physiological amounts of this gas are neuroprotective, whereas higher concentrations are clearly neurotoxic.},

abstract = {Recent epidemiological studies suggest that diabetes mellitus is a strong risk factor for Alzheimer disease. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, to investigate the pathophysiological interaction between these diseases, we generated animal models that reflect the pathologic conditions of both diseases. We crossed Alzheimer transgenic mice (APP23) with two types of diabetic mice (ob/ob and NSY mice), and analyzed their metabolic and brain pathology. The onset of diabetes exacerbated Alzheimer-like cognitive dysfunction without an increase in brain amyloid-beta burden in double-mutant (APP(+)-ob/ob) mice. Notably, APP(+)-ob/ob mice showed cerebrovascular inflammation and severe amyloid angiopathy. Conversely, the cross-bred mice showed an accelerated diabetic phenotype compared with ob/ob mice, suggesting that Alzheimer amyloid pathology could aggravate diabetes. Similarly, APP(+)-NSY fusion mice showed more severe glucose intolerance compared with diabetic NSY mice. Furthermore, high-fat diet feeding induced severe memory deficits in APP(+)-NSY mice without an increase in brain amyloid-beta load. Here, we created Alzheimer mouse models with early onset of cognitive dysfunction. Cerebrovascular changes and alteration in brain insulin signaling might play a pivotal role in this relationship. These findings could provide insights into this intensely debated association.},

abstract = {Modern neuroimaging techniques rely on neurovascular coupling to show regions of increased brain activation. However, little is known of the neurovascular coupling relationships that exist for inhibitory signals. To address this issue directly we developed a preparation to investigate the signal sources of one of these proposed inhibitory neurovascular signals, the negative blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response (NBR), in rat somatosensory cortex. We found a reliable NBR measured in rat somatosensory cortex in response to unilateral electrical whisker stimulation, which was located in deeper cortical layers relative to the positive BOLD response. Separate optical measurements (two-dimensional optical imaging spectroscopy and laser Doppler flowmetry) revealed that the NBR was a result of decreased blood volume and flow and increased levels of deoxyhemoglobin. Neural activity in the NBR region, measured by multichannel electrodes, varied considerably as a function of cortical depth. There was a decrease in neuronal activity in deep cortical laminae. After cessation of whisker stimulation there was a large increase in neural activity above baseline. Both the decrease in neuronal activity and increase above baseline after stimulation cessation correlated well with the simultaneous measurement of blood flow suggesting that the NBR is related to decreases in neural activity in deep cortical layers. Interestingly, the magnitude of the neural decrease was largest in regions showing stimulus-evoked positive BOLD responses. Since a similar type of neural suppression in surround regions was associated with a negative BOLD signal, the increased levels of suppression in positive BOLD regions could importantly moderate the size of the observed BOLD response.},

Ultimately, this would lead to BBB compromise, to chemical imbalance in the neuronal environment and to synaptic and neuronal dysfunction, injury and loss. Based on the neurovascular hypothesis, I suggest an array of new potential therapeutic approaches that could be developed for AD, to enhance A beta clearance and neurovascular repair, and to protect the neurovascular unit from divergent inducers of injury and apoptosis.},

Recent advances in high-resolution imaging enable highly detailed three-dimensional geometrical representation of the whole-tumor microvascular architecture. This enormous increase in complexity of image-based data necessitates the application of informatics methods for the analysis, mining and reconstruction of these spatial graph data structures. We present a novel methodology that combines ex-vivo high-resolution micro-computed tomography imaging data with a bioimage informatics algorithm to track and reconstruct the whole-tumor vasculature of a human breast cancer model. The reconstructed tumor vascular network is used as an input of a computational model that estimates blood flow in each segment of the tumor microvascular network. This formulation involves a well-established biophysical model and an optimization algorithm that ensures mass balance and detailed monitoring of all the vessels that feed and drain blood from the tumor microvascular network. Perfusion maps for the whole-tumor microvascular network are computed. Morphological and hemodynamic indices from different regions are compared to infer their role in overall tumor perfusion.},

In the clinic, unequivocal electrophysiological evidence now exists that spreading depolarizations occur abundantly in individuals with aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage, delayed ischemic stroke after subarachnoid hemorrhage, malignant hemispheric stroke, spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage or traumatic brain injury. Spreading depolarization is induced experimentally by various noxious conditions including chemicals such as potassium, glutamate, inhibitors of the sodium pump, status epilepticus, hypoxia, hypoglycemia and ischemia, but it can can also invade healthy, naive tissue. Resistance vessels respond to it with tone alterations, causing either transient hyperperfusion (physiological hemodynamic response) in healthy tissue or severe hypoperfusion (inverse hemodynamic response, or spreading ischemia) in tissue at risk for progressive damage, which contributes to lesion progression. Therapies that target spreading depolarization or the inverse hemodynamic response may potentially treat these neurological conditions.},

Moreover, the BBB maintains the chemical composition of the neuronal "milieu," which is required for proper functioning of neuronal circuits, synaptic transmission, synaptic remodeling, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis in the adult brain. BBB breakdown, due to disruption of the tight junctions, altered transport of molecules between blood and brain and brain and blood, aberrant angiogenesis, vessel regression, brain hypoperfusion, and inflammatory responses, may initiate and/or contribute to a "vicious circle" of the disease process, resulting in progressive synaptic and neuronal dysfunction and loss in disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and others.

abstract = {Cerebral autoregulation (CA) is an most important mechanism responsible for the relatively constant blood flow supply to brain when cerebral perfusion pressure varies. Its assessment in nonacute cases has been relied on the quantification of the relationship between noninvasive beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) and blood flow velocity (BFV). To overcome the nonstationary nature of physiological signals such as BP and BFV, a computational method called multimodal pressure-flow (MMPF) analysis was recently developed to study the nonlinear BP-BFV relationship during the Valsalva maneuver (VM). The present study aimed to determine (i) whether this method can estimate autoregulation from spontaneous BP and BFV fluctuations during baseline rest conditions; (ii) whether there is any difference between the MMPF measures of autoregulation based on intra-arterial BP (ABP) and based on cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP); and (iii) whether the MMPF method provides reproducible and reliable measure for noninvasive assessment of autoregulation. To achieve these aims, we analyzed data from existing databases including: (i) ABP and BFV of 12 healthy control, 10 hypertensive, and 10 stroke subjects during baseline resting conditions and during the Valsalva maneuver, and (ii) ABP, CPP, and BFV of 30 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who were being paralyzed, sedated, and ventilated. We showed that autoregulation in healthy control subjects can be characterized by specific phase shifts between BP and BFV oscillations during the Valsalva maneuver, and the BP-BFV phase shifts were reduced in hypertensive and stroke subjects (P < 0.01), indicating impaired autoregulation. Similar results were found during baseline condition from spontaneous BP and BFV oscillations. The BP-BFV phase shifts obtained during baseline and during VM were highly correlated (R > 0.8, P < 0.0001), showing no statistical difference (paired-t test P > 0.47). In TBI patients there were strong correlations between phases of ABP and CPP oscillations (R = 0.99, P < 0.0001) and, thus, between ABP-BFV and CPP-BFV phase shifts (P < 0.0001, R = 0.76). By repeating the MMPF 4 times on data of TBI subjects, each time on a selected cycle of spontaneous BP and BFV oscillations, we showed that MMPF had better reproducibility than traditional autoregulation index. These results indicate that the MMPF method, based on instantaneous phase relationships between cerebral blood flow velocity and peripheral blood pressure, has better performance than the traditional standard method, and can reliably assess cerebral autoregulation dynamics from ambulatory blood pressure and cerebral blood flow during supine rest conditions.},

abstract = {Neurovascular coupling in response to stimulation of the rat barrel cortex was investigated using concurrent multichannel electrophysiology and laser Doppler flowmetry. The data were used to build a linear dynamic model relating neural activity to blood flow. Local field potential time series were subject to current source density analysis, and the time series of a layer IV sink of the barrel cortex was used as the input to the model. The model output was the time series of the changes in regional cerebral blood flow (CBF). We show that this model can provide excellent fit of the CBF responses for stimulus durations of up to 16 s. The structure of the model consisted of two coupled components representing vascular dilation and constriction. The complex temporal characteristics of the CBF time series were reproduced by the relatively simple balance of these two components. We show that the impulse response obtained under the 16-s duration stimulation condition generalised to provide a good prediction to the data from the shorter duration stimulation conditions. Furthermore, by optimising three out of the total of nine model parameters, the variability in the data can be well accounted for over a wide range of stimulus conditions. By establishing linearity, classic system analysis methods can be used to generate and explore a range of equivalent model structures (e.g., feed-forward or feedback) to guide the experimental investigation of the control of vascular dilation and constriction following stimulation.},

abstract = {Astroglia from the postnatal cerebral cortex can be reprogrammed in vitro to generate neurons following forced expression of neurogenic transcription factors, thus opening new avenues towards a potential use of endogenous astroglia for brain repair. However, in previous attempts astroglia-derived neurons failed to establish functional synapses, a severe limitation towards functional neurogenesis. It remained therefore also unknown whether neurons derived from reprogrammed astroglia could be directed towards distinct neuronal subtype identities by selective expression of distinct neurogenic fate determinants. Here we show that strong and persistent expression of neurogenic fate determinants driven by silencing-resistant retroviral vectors instructs astroglia from the postnatal cortex in vitro to mature into fully functional, synapse-forming neurons. Importantly, the neurotransmitter fate choice of astroglia-derived neurons can be controlled by selective expression of distinct neurogenic transcription factors: forced expression of the dorsal telencephalic fate determinant neurogenin-2 (Neurog2) directs cortical astroglia to generate synapse-forming glutamatergic neurons; in contrast, the ventral telencephalic fate determinant Dlx2 induces a GABAergic identity, although the overall efficiency of Dlx2-mediated neuronal reprogramming is much lower compared to Neurog2, suggesting that cortical astroglia possess a higher competence to respond to the dorsal telencephalic fate determinant. Interestingly, however, reprogramming of astroglia towards the generation of GABAergic neurons was greatly facilitated when the astroglial cells were first expanded as neurosphere cells prior to transduction with Dlx2. Importantly, this approach of expansion under neurosphere conditions and subsequent reprogramming with distinct neurogenic transcription factors can also be extended to reactive astroglia isolated from the adult injured cerebral cortex, allowing for the selective generation of glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. These data provide evidence that cortical astroglia can undergo a conversion across cell lineages by forced expression of a single neurogenic transcription factor, stably generating fully differentiated neurons. Moreover, neuronal reprogramming of astroglia is not restricted to postnatal stages but can also be achieved from terminally differentiated astroglia of the adult cerebral cortex following injury-induced reactivation.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with a cascade of pathological events involving formation of amyloid-based neuritic plaques and tau-based neurofibrillary tangles, changes in brain structure and function, and eventually, cognitive impairment and functional disability. The precise sequence of when each of these disease markers becomes abnormal is not yet clearly understood. The present study systematically tested the relationship between classes of biomarkers according to a proposed model of temporal sequence by Jack et al. (Lancet Neurology 9:119-128, 2010). We examined temporal relations among four classes of biomarkers: CSF A$\beta$, CSF tau, neuroimaging variables (hippocampal volume, ventricular volume, FDG PET), and cognitive variables (memory and executive function). Random effects modeling of longitudinal data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was used to test hypotheses that putative earlier markers of AD predicted change in later markers, and that intervening markers reduced effects of earlier on later markers. Specifically, we hypothesized that CSF tau would explain CSF A$\beta$'s relation to neuroimaging and cognitive variables, and neuroimaging variables would explain tau's relation to cognitive variables. Consistent with hypotheses, results indicated that CSF A$\beta$ effects on cognition change were substantially attenuated by CSF tau and measures of brain structure and function, and CSF tau effects on cognitive change were attenuated by neuroimaging variables. Contrary to hypotheses, CSF A$\beta$ and CSF tau were observed to have independent effects on neuroimaging and CSF tau had a direct effect on baseline cognition independent of brain structure and function. These results have implications for clarifying the temporal sequence of AD changes and corresponding biomarkers.},

abstract = {A principal means of transmitting intracellular calcium (Ca2+) waves at junctions between astrocytes involves the release of the chemical transmitter adenosine triphosphate (ATP). A model of this process is presented in which activation of purinergic P2Y receptors by ATP triggers the release of ATP, in an autocrine manner, as well as concomitantly increasing intracellular Ca2+. The dependence of the temporal characteristics of the Ca2+ wave are shown to critically depend on the dissociation constant (K(R)) for ATP binding to the P2Y receptor type. Incorporating this model astrocyte into networks of these cells successfully accounts for many of the properties of propagating Ca2+ waves, such as the dependence of velocity on the type of P2Y receptor and the time-lag of the Ca2+ wave behind the ATP wave. In addition, the conditions under which Ca2+ waves may jump from one set of astrocytes across an astrocyte-free lane to another set of astrocytes are quantitatively accounted for by the model. The properties of purinergic transmission at astrocyte junctions may determine many of the characteristics of Ca2+ propagation in networks of these cells.},

abstract = {Astrocytes are considered the third component of the synapse, responding to neurotransmitter release from synaptic terminals and releasing gliotransmitters--including glutamate--in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner to affect neuronal synaptic activity. Many studies reporting astrocyte-driven neuronal activity have evoked astrocyte Ca(2+) increases by application of endogenous ligands that directly activate neuronal receptors, making astrocyte contribution to neuronal effect(s) difficult to determine. We have made transgenic mice that express a Gq-coupled receptor only in astrocytes to evoke astrocyte Ca(2+) increases using an agonist that does not bind endogenous receptors in brain. By recording from CA1 pyramidal cells in acute hippocampal slices from these mice, we demonstrate that widespread Ca(2+) elevations in 80\%-90\% of stratum radiatum astrocytes do not increase neuronal Ca(2+), produce neuronal slow inward currents, or affect excitatory synaptic activity. Our findings call into question the developing consensus that Ca(2+)-dependent glutamate release by astrocytes directly affects neuronal synaptic activity in situ.},

abstract = {During saccadic motion the eyewall moves in a manner similar to a sinusoid or at least can be represented by a sine Fourier series. Motion of the vitreous is induced by the saccade and the vitreo-retinal interface is subjected to a time-dependent shear. This force may be a significant factor for retinal tearing in the neighbourhood of small retinal holes or tears. An analytical viscoelastic model and a numerical, Newtonian model of the motion of the vitreous are presented and compared. Under sinusoidal boundary motion the analytical model shows that a viscous wave propagates inward toward the axis of rotation and the characteristic length of this wave is a function of the Womersley number. The numerical solution indicates that the vitreous moves similarly to the analytical result with small secondary motion; however, this motion allows complete recirculation of the vitreous over large timescales. Excellent agreement is found between the analytical and numerical models. The time-dependent fluid shear is evaluated and from the analytical solution the maximum value of this is found to be proportional to R0 square root of v(omega)3, where R0 is the eye radius, v the modified complex viscosity and omega the sinusoidal frequency. This indicates that myopes have a larger shear force exerted on them by virtue of the larger eye size. Further work is directed toward a model which links the stress found in the sclera to that exerted on the vitreo-retinal interface by the vitreous fluid motion.},

abstract = {The link between atherosclerosis and regions of disturbed flow and low wall shear stress is now firmly established, but the causal mechanisms underlying the link are not yet understood. It is now recognised that the endothelium is not simply a passive barrier between the blood and the vessel wall, but plays an active role in maintaining vascular homeostasis and participates in the onset of atherosclerosis. Calcium signalling is one of the principal intracellular signalling mechanisms by which endothelial cells (EC) respond to external stimuli, such as fluid shear stress and ligand binding. Previous studies have separately modelled mass transport of chemical species in the bloodstream and calcium dynamics in EC via the inositol trisphosphate (IP(3)) signalling pathway. We review existing models of these two phenomena, before going on to integrate the two components to provide an inclusive new model for the calcium response of the endothelium in an arbitrary vessel geometry. This enables the combined effects of fluid flow and biochemical stimulation on EC to be investigated and is the first time spatially varying, physiological fluid flow-related environmental factors have been combined with intracellular signalling in a mathematical model. Model results show that low endothelial calcium levels in the area of disturbed flow at an arterial widening may be one contributing factor to the onset of vascular disease.},

abstract = {Vascular dysfunction has a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent data from brain imaging studies in humans and animal models suggest that cerebrovascular dysfunction may precede cognitive decline and onset of neurodegenerative changes in AD and AD models. Cerebral hypoperfusion and impaired amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) clearance across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may contribute to the onset and progression of dementia AD type. Decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) negatively affects the synthesis of proteins required for memory and learning, and may eventually lead to neuritic injury and neuronal death. Impaired clearance of Abeta from the brain by the cells of the neurovascular unit may lead to its accumulation on blood vessels and in brain parenchyma. The accumulation of Abeta on the cerebral blood vessels, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is associated with cognitive decline and is one of the hallmarks of AD pathology. CAA can severely disrupt the integrity of the blood vessel wall resulting in micro or macro intracerebral bleedings that exacerbates neurodegenerative process and inflammatory response and may lead to hemorrhagic stroke, respectively. Here, we review the role of the neurovascular unit and molecular mechanisms in vascular cells behind AD and CAA pathogenesis. First, we discuss apparent vascular changes, including the cerebral hypoperfusion and vascular degeneration that contribute to different stages of the disease process in AD individuals. We next discuss the role of the low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP), a key Abeta clearance receptor at the BBB and along the cerebrovascular system, whose expression is suppressed early in AD. We also discuss how brain-derived apolipoprotein E isoforms may influence Abeta clearance across the BBB. We then review the role of two interacting transcription factors, myocardin and serum response factor, in cerebral vascular cells in controlling CBF responses and LRP-mediated Abeta clearance. Finally, we discuss the role of microglia and perivascular macrophages in Abeta clearance from the brain. The data reviewed here support an essential role of neurovascular and BBB mechanisms in contributing to both, onset and progression of AD.},

abstract = {S100B is an EF-hand calcium-binding protein that exerts both intracellular and extracellular effects on a variety of cellular processes. The protein is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system by astrocytes, both physiologically and during the course of neurological disease. In the healthy adult brain and during development, constitutive S100B expression acts as a trophic factor to drive neurite extension and to referee neuroplasticity. Yet, when induced during central nervous system disease, the protein can take on maladaptive roles and thereby exacerbate brain pathology. Based on genetic and pharmacological lines of evidence, we consider such deleterious roles of S100B in two common brain pathologies: ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In rodent models of ischemic brain damage, S100B is induced early on during the subacute phase, where it exacerbates gliosis and delayed infarct expansion and thereby worsens functional recovery. In mouse models of AD, S100B drives brain inflammation and gliosis that accelerate cerebral amyloidosis. Pharmacological inhibition of S100B synthesis mitigates hallmark pathologies of both brain diseases, opening the door for translational approaches to treat these devastating neurological disorders.},

@article{Peers2009,
abstract = {Periods of chronic hypoxia, which can arise from numerous cardiorespiratory disorders, predispose individuals to the development of dementias, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is characterized in part by the increased production of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), which forms the extracellular plaques by which the disease can be identified post mortem. Numerous studies have now shown that hypoxia, even in vitro, can increase production of Abeta in different cell types. Evidence has been produced to indicate hypoxia alters both expression of the Abeta precursor, APP, and also the expression of the secretase enzymes, which cleave Abeta from APP. Other studies implicate reduced Abeta degradation as a possible means by which hypoxia increases Abeta levels. Such variability may be attributable to cell-specific responses to hypoxia. Further evidence indicates that some, but not all of the cellular adaptations to chronic hypoxia (including alteration of Ca(2+) homeostasis) require Abeta formation. However, other aspects of hypoxic remodeling of cell function appear to occur independently of this process. The molecular and cellular responses to hypoxia contribute to our understanding of the clinical association of hypoxia and increased incidence of AD. However, it remains to be determined whether inhibition of one or more of the effects of hypoxia may be of benefit in arresting the development of this neurodegenerative disease.},

abstract = {Amyloid-$\beta$ interacts with two cell surface receptors, CD36 and CD47, through which the matricellular protein thrombospondin-1 inhibits soluble guanylate cyclase activation. Here we examine whether amyloid-$\beta$ shares this inhibitory activity. Amyloid-$\beta$ inhibited both drug and nitric oxide-mediated activation of soluble guanylate cyclase in several cell types. Known cGMP-dependent functional responses to nitric oxide in platelets and vascular smooth muscle cells were correspondingly inhibited by amyloid-$\beta$. Functional interaction of amyloid-$\beta$ with the scavenger receptor CD36 was indicated by inhibition of free fatty acid uptake via this receptor. Both soluble oligomer and fibrillar forms of amyloid-$\beta$ were active. In contrast, amyloid-$\beta$ did not compete with the known ligand SIRP$\alpha$ for binding to CD47. However, both receptors were necessary for amyloid-$\beta$ to inhibit cGMP accumulation. These data suggest that amyloid-$\beta$ interaction with CD36 induces a CD47-dependent signal that inhibits soluble guanylate cyclase activation. Combined with the pleiotropic effects of inhibiting free fatty acid transport via CD36, these data provides a molecular mechanism through which amyloid-$\beta$ can contribute to the nitric oxide signaling deficiencies associated with Alzheimer's disease.},

Cells at three key interfaces form barriers between the blood and the CNS: the blood-brain barrier (BBB), blood-CSF barrier and the arachnoid barrier. The BBB at the level of brain microvessel endothelium is the major site of blood-CNS exchange. The structure and function of the BBB is summarised, the physical barrier formed by the endothelial tight junctions, and the transport barrier resulting from membrane transporters and vesicular mechanisms. The roles of associated cells are outlined, especially the endfeet of astrocytic glial cells, and pericytes and microglia. The embryonic development of the BBB, and changes in pathology are described. The BBB is subject to short and long-term regulation, which may be disturbed in pathology. Any programme for drug discovery or delivery, to target or avoid the CNS, needs to consider the special features of the BBB.},

@article{Hamilton2010,
abstract = {Because regional blood flow increases in association with the increased metabolic demand generated by localized increases in neural activity, functional imaging researchers often assume that changes in blood flow are an accurate read-out of changes in underlying neural activity. An understanding of the mechanisms that link changes in neural activity to changes in blood flow is crucial for assessing the validity of this assumption, and for understanding the processes that can go wrong during disease states such as ischaemic stroke. Many studies have investigated the mechanisms of neurovascular regulation in arterioles but other evidence suggests that blood flow regulation can also occur in capillaries, because of the presence of contractile cells, pericytes, on the capillary wall. Here we review the evidence that pericytes can modulate capillary diameter in response to neuronal activity and assess the likely importance of neurovascular regulation at the capillary level for functional imaging experiments. We also discuss evidence suggesting that pericytes are particularly sensitive to damage during pathological insults such as ischaemia, Alzheimer's disease and diabetic retinopathy, and consider the potential impact that pericyte dysfunction might have on the development of therapeutic interventions and on the interpretation of functional imaging data in these disorders.},

The presence of hypertension and other vascular risk factors has been associated with decreased performance in executive function and attention tests. Cerebrovascular reserve has emerged as a potential biomarker for monitoring pressure-perfusion-cognition relationships. A decline in vascular reserve capacity can lead to impaired neurovascular coupling and decreased cognitive ability. Endothelial dysfunction, microvascular disease, and mascrovascular disease in midlife could also have an important role in the manifestations and severity of multiple medical conditions underlying cognitive decline late in life. However, questions remain about the role of antihypertensive therapies for long-term prevention of cognitive decline. In this Review, we address the underlying pathophysiology and the existing evidence supporting the role of vascular factors in late-life cognitive decline.},

We perform Bayesian Flux Balance Analysis (BFBA) with a new mathematical model of cellular brain energetics, comprising detailed biochemical pathways in and between astrocytes and glutamatergic neurons and partitioning of each cell type into cytosol and mitochondria. Supported by the results of our in silico studies, which are in remarkable agreement with previously published results, we posit the Glucose Shunt Hypothesis (GSH) that during high activity, the inhibition of the phosphofructokinase (PFK) enzyme in neuron impairs neuronal glycolysis, enabling the process by which lactate effluxed by astrocytes is taken up by glutamatergic neurons, whereas at low activity, glucose remains the preferred substrate for neurons. We postulate that the ANLS is a shunt utilized by glutamatergic neurons to bypass their glycolysis impaired by the inhibition of PFK in connection with increased oxidative phosphorylation at high neuronal activity.},

abstract = {In spite of intense recent investigation of the physiological and pathophysiological roles of endogenously produced nitric oxide (.NO) in mammalian systems, little quantitative information exists concerning the diffusion of this small nonelectrolyte from its source (NO synthase) to its targets of action. I present here a conceptual framework for analyzing the intracellular and intercellular diffusion and reaction of free .NO, using kinetic modeling and calculations of the diffusibility of .NO and its reactions in aqueous solution based on published data. If the half-life of .NO is greater than approximately 25 msec and the rates of reaction of .NO with its targets are slower than its diffusion or reaction with O2 (for which there is experimental evidence in at least some systems), then (i) .NO acts in vivo in a mostly paracrine fashion for a collection of .NO-producing cells, (ii) .NO diffuses to significant concentrations at distances relatively far removed from a single .NO-producing cell, and (iii) localized sites of vascularization will scavenge .NO (and thus decrease its actions) at distances many cell diameters away from that site. These conclusions have important implications with regard to the mechanism of endothelium-dependent relaxation, the autocrine vs. paracrine actions of .NO, and the role of the spatial relationship between specific sites of .NO formation and neighboring blood vessels in .NO-effected and -affected neuronal signal transmission.},

Subsequent coapplication of L-NA and increased K+ induced only an elevation of +7 +/- 4\% above baseline (n = 4). (c) When the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) was added during NOS inhibition to restore basal tissue NO levels, the resultant level of rCBF was +28 +/- 54\% above baseline. Subsequent increase of K+ in the presence of NOS inhibition and SNAP elevated rCBF to +137 +/- 89\% above baseline (n = 4).},

abstract = {Purinergic signaling plays important roles in control of vascular tone and remodeling. There is dual control of vascular tone by ATP released as a cotransmitter with noradrenaline from perivascular sympathetic nerves to cause vasoconstriction via P2X1 receptors, whereas ATP released from endothelial cells in response to changes in blood flow (producing shear stress) or hypoxia acts on P2X and P2Y receptors on endothelial cells to produce nitric oxide and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, which dilates vessels. ATP is also released from sensory-motor nerves during antidromic reflex activity to produce relaxation of some blood vessels. In this review, we stress the differences in neural and endothelial factors in purinergic control of different blood vessels. The long-term (trophic) actions of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides and nucleotides in promoting migration and proliferation of both vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells via P1 and P2Y receptors during angiogenesis and vessel remodeling during restenosis after angioplasty are described. The pathophysiology of blood vessels and therapeutic potential of purinergic agents in diseases, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, ischemia, thrombosis and stroke, diabetes, and migraine, is discussed.},

abstract = {The brain is critically dependent on a continuous supply of blood to function. Therefore, the cerebral vasculature is endowed with neurovascular control mechanisms that assure that the blood supply of the brain is commensurate to the energy needs of its cellular constituents. The regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) during brain activity involves the coordinated interaction of neurons, glia, and vascular cells. Thus, whereas neurons and glia generate the signals initiating the vasodilation, endothelial cells, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells act in concert to transduce these signals into carefully orchestrated vascular changes that lead to CBF increases focused to the activated area and temporally linked to the period of activation. Neurovascular coupling is disrupted in pathological conditions, such as hypertension, Alzheimer disease, and ischemic stroke. Consequently, CBF is no longer matched to the metabolic requirements of the tissue. This cerebrovascular dysregulation is mediated in large part by the deleterious action of reactive oxygen species on cerebral blood vessels. A major source of cerebral vascular radicals in models of hypertension and Alzheimer disease is the enzyme NADPH oxidase. These findings, collectively, highlight the importance of neurovascular coupling to the health of the normal brain and suggest a therapeutic target for improving brain function in pathologies associated with cerebrovascular dysfunction.},

abstract = {Increasing evidence supports a crucial role for glial metabolism in maintaining proper synaptic function and in the etiology of neurological disease. However, the study of glial metabolism in humans has been hampered by the lack of noninvasive methods. To specifically measure the contribution of astroglia to brain energy metabolism in humans, we used a novel noninvasive nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic approach. We measured carbon 13 incorporation into brain glutamate and glutamine in eight volunteers during an intravenous infusion of [2-13C] acetate, which has been shown in animal models to be metabolized specifically in astroglia. Mathematical modeling of the three established pathways for neurotransmitter glutamate repletion indicates that the glutamate/glutamine neurotransmitter cycle between astroglia and neurons (0.32 +/- 0.07 micromol x gm(-1) x min(-1)) is the major pathway for neuronal glutamate repletion and that the astroglial TCA cycle flux (0.14 +/- 0.06 micromol x gm(-1) x min(-1)) accounts for approximately 14\% of brain oxygen consumption. Up to 30\% of the glutamine transferred to the neurons by the cycle may derive from replacement of oxidized glutamate by anaplerosis. The further application of this approach could potentially enlighten the role of astroglia in supporting brain glutamatergic activity and in neurological and psychiatric disease.},

The NVU controls blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and cerebral blood flow, and maintains the chemical composition of the neuronal 'milieu', which is required for proper functioning of neuronal circuits. Recent evidence indicates that BBB dysfunction is associated with the accumulation of several vasculotoxic and neurotoxic molecules within brain parenchyma, a reduction in cerebral blood flow, and hypoxia. Together, these vascular-derived insults might initiate and/or contribute to neuronal degeneration. This article examines mechanisms of BBB dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders, notably Alzheimer's disease, and highlights therapeutic opportunities relating to these neurovascular deficits.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) produced by vascular endothelial cells is a potent vasodilator and an antiinflammatory mediator. Regulating production of endothelial-derived NO is a complex undertaking, involving multiple signaling and genetic pathways that are activated by diverse humoral and biomechanical stimuli. To gain a thorough understanding of the rich diversity of responses observed experimentally, it is necessary to account for an ensemble of these pathways acting simultaneously. In this article, we have assembled four quantitative molecular pathways previously proposed for shear-stress-induced NO production. In these pathways, endothelial NO synthase is activated 1), via calcium release, 2), via phosphorylation reactions, and 3), via enhanced protein expression. To these activation pathways, we have added a fourth, a pathway describing actual NO production from endothelial NO synthase and its various protein partners. These pathways were combined and simulated using CytoSolve, a computational environment for combining independent pathway calculations. The integrated model is able to describe the experimentally observed change in NO production with time after the application of fluid shear stress. This model can also be used to predict the specific effects on the system after interventional pharmacological or genetic changes. Importantly, this model reflects the up-to-date understanding of the NO system, providing a platform upon which information can be aggregated in an additive way. © 2013 Biophysical Society.},

Age-related and hypertension-related small vessel diseases and cerebral amyloid angiopathy are the most common forms. The consequences of small vessel disease on the brain parenchyma are mainly lesions located in the subcortical structures such as lacunar infarcts, white matter lesions, large haemorrhages, and microbleeds. Because lacunar infarcts and white matter lesions are easily detected by neuroimaging, whereas small vessels are not, the term small vessel disease is frequently used to describe the parenchyma lesions rather than the underlying small vessel alterations. This classification, however, restricts the definition of small vessel disease to ischaemic lesions and might be misleading. Small vessel disease has an important role in cerebrovascular disease and is a leading cause of cognitive decline and functional loss in the elderly. Small vessel disease should be a main target for preventive and treatment strategies, but all types of presentation and complications should be taken into account.},

This model takes into account intracellular Ca2+ dynamics, membrane potential, a non-selective cation channel, and two Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels, as well as intra- and extracellular Ca2+ sources. The model reproduces the experimental data available, and predicts certain quantities which would be hard to obtain experimentally, like the individual K+ channel currents when the membrane potential is allowed to freely evolve, the implication of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), and the total K+ released during stimulation. The main results are: (1) the large-conductance K+ channel participates only very little in the overall response; (2) EETs are required in order to explain the experimental current-potential relationships, but are not an essential component of the bradykinin response; and (3) the total K+ released during stimulation gives rise to a concentration in the intercellular space which is of millimolar order. This concentration change is compatible with the hypothesis that K+ contributes to the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor phenomenon.},

In a cortical brain region of interest (ROI), displaying high CAA, arcA beta mice older than 16 months showed reduced response to the vasodilatory substance acetazolamide compared to age-matched wild-type animals, both with regard to rate (vascular reactivity) and extent of vasodilation (maximal vasodilation). In a subcortical ROI, displaying little CAA, no genotype-specific decrease was observed, but maximal vasodilation decreased with age in arcA beta and wild-types. These findings indicate that vascular beta-amyloid deposits reduce the capacity of cerebral blood vessels to dilate upon demand, supporting the hypothesis that vascular beta-amyloid contributes to hypoperfusion and neurological deficits observed in AD and CAA. High diagnostic accuracy of the combined readouts in detecting vascular dysfunction in arcA beta mice was found.},

abstract = {A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach was presented to model the blood flows in the carotid bifurcation and the brain arteries under altered gravity. Physical models required for CFD simulation were introduced including a model for arterial wall motion due to fluid-wall interactions, a shear thinning fluid model of blood, a vascular bed model for outflow boundary conditions, and a model for autoregulation mechanism. The three-dimensional unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled with these models were solved iteratively using the pseudocompressibility method and dual time stepping. Gravity source terms were added to the Navier-Stokes equations to take the effect of gravity into account. For the treatment of complex geometry, a chimera overset grid technique was adopted to obtain connectivity between arterial branches. For code validation, computed results were compared with experimental data for both steady-state and time-dependent flows. This computational approach was then applied to blood flows through a realistic carotid bifurcation and two Circle of Willis models, one using an idealized geometry and the other using an anatomical data set. A three-dimensional Circle of Willis configuration was reconstructed from subject-specific magnetic resonance images using an image segmentation method. Through the numerical simulation of blood flow in two model problems, namely, the carotid bifurcation and the brain arteries, it was observed that the altered gravity has considerable effects on arterial contraction/dilatation and consequent changes in flow conditions.},

abstract = {The brain is critically dependent on a continuous supply of blood to function. Therefore, the cerebral vasculature is endowed with neurovascular control mechanisms that assure that the blood supply of the brain is commensurate to the energy needs of its cellular constituents. The regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) during brain activity involves the coordinated interaction of neurons, glia, and vascular cells. Thus, whereas neurons and glia generate the signals initiating the vasodilation, endothelial cells, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells act in concert to transduce these signals into carefully orchestrated vascular changes that lead to CBF increases focused to the activated area and temporally linked to the period of activation. Neurovascular coupling is disrupted in pathological conditions, such as hypertension, Alzheimer disease, and ischemic stroke. Consequently, CBF is no longer matched to the metabolic requirements of the tissue. This cerebrovascular dysregulation is mediated in large part by the deleterious action of reactive oxygen species on cerebral blood vessels. A major source of cerebral vascular radicals in models of hypertension and Alzheimer disease is the enzyme NADPH oxidase. These findings, collectively, highlight the importance of neurovascular coupling to the health of the normal brain and suggest a therapeutic target for improving brain function in pathologies associated with cerebrovascular dysfunction.},

@article{Kavdia2004,
abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in autocrine and paracrine manner in numerous physiological processes, including regulation of blood pressure and blood flow, platelet aggregation, and leukocyte adhesion. In vascular wall, most of the bioavailable NO is believed to derive from endothelial cell NO synthase (eNOS). Recently, neuronal NOS (nNOS) has been identified as a source of NO in the vicinity of microvessels and has been shown to participate in vascular function. Thus NO can be produced and transported to the vascular smooth muscle cells from 1). endothelial cells and 2). perivascular nerve fibers, mast cells, and other nNOS-containing sources. In this study, a mathematical model of NO diffusion-reaction in a cylindrical arteriolar segment was formulated. The model quantifies the relative contribution of these NO sources and the smooth muscle availability of NO in a tissue containing an arteriolar blood vessel. The results indicate that a source of NO derived through nNOS in the perivascular region can be a significant contributor to smooth muscle NO. Predicted smooth muscle NO concentrations are as high as 430 nM, which is consistent with reported experimental measurements approximately 400 nM). In addition, we used the model to analyze the smooth muscle NO availability in 1). eNOS and nNOS knockout experiments, 2). the presence of myoglobin, and 3). the presence of cell-free Hb, e.g., Hb-based oxygen carriers. The results show that NO release by nNOS would significantly affect available smooth muscle NO. Further experimental and theoretical studies are required to account for distribution of NOS isoforms and determine NO availability in vasculatures of different tissues.},

abstract = {Shear stress stimulates nitric oxide (NO) production by phosphorylating endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) at Ser(1179) in a phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)- and protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent manner. The eNOS has additional potential phosphorylation sites, including Ser(116), Thr(497), and Ser(635). Here, we studied these potential phosphorylation sites in response to shear, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and 8-bromocAMP (8-BRcAMP) in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). All three stimuli induced phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser(635), which was consistently slower than that at Ser(1179). Thr(497) was rapidly dephosphorylated by 8-BRcAMP but not by shear and VEGF. None of the stimuli phosphorylated Ser(116). Whereas shear-stimulated Ser(635) phosphorylation was not affected by phosphoinositide-3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY-294002, it was blocked by either treating the cells with a PKA inhibitor H89 or infecting them with a recombinant adenovirus-expressing PKA inhibitor. These results suggest that shear stress stimulates eNOS by two different mechanisms: 1) PKA- and PI3K-dependent and 2) PKA-dependent but PI3K-independent pathways. Phosphorylation of Ser(635) may play an important role in chronic regulation of eNOS in response to mechanical and humoral stimuli.},

abstract = {Neuronal activity evokes localized changes in blood flow. Although this response, termed neurovascular coupling, is widely used to monitor human brain function and diagnose pathology, the cellular mechanisms that mediate the response remain unclear. We investigated the contribution of glial cells to neurovascular coupling in the acutely isolated mammalian retina. We found that light stimulation and glial cell stimulation can both evoke dilation or constriction of arterioles. Light-evoked and glial-evoked vasodilations were blocked by inhibitors of cytochrome P450 epoxygenase, the synthetic enzyme for epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. Vasoconstrictions, in contrast, were blocked by an inhibitor of omega-hydroxylase, which synthesizes 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Nitric oxide influenced whether vasodilations or vasoconstrictions were produced in response to light and glial stimulation. Light-evoked vasoactivity was blocked when neuron-to-glia signaling was interrupted by a purinergic antagonist. These results indicate that glial cells contribute to neurovascular coupling and suggest that regulation of blood flow may involve both vasodilating and vasoconstricting components.},

To determine mechanistic differences in the regulation of endothelial constitutive NO synthase (ecNOS), we measured NO production by bovine aortic endothelial cells exposed to shear stress in a laminar flow chamber or treated with Ca2+ ionophores in static culture. The kinetics of cumulative NO production varied strikingly: shear stress (25 dyne/cm2) stimulated a biphasic increase over control that was 13-fold at 60 minutes, whereas raising [Ca2+]i caused a monophasic 6-fold increase. We hypothesized that activation of a protein kinase cascade mediates the early phase of flow-dependent NO production. Immunoprecipitation of ecNOS showed a 210\% increase in phosphorylation 1 minute after flow initiation, whereas there was no significant increase after Ca2+ ionophore treatment. Although ecNOS was not tyrosine-phosphorylated, the early phase of flow-dependent NO production was blocked by genistein, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases. To determine the Ca2+ requirement for flow-dependent NO production, we measured [Ca2+]i with a novel flow-step protocol. [Ca2+]i increased with the onset of shear stress, but not after a step increase. However, the step increase in shear stress was associated with a potent biphasic increase in NO production rate and ecNOS phosphorylation. These studies demonstrate that shear stress can increase NO production in the absence of increased [Ca2+]i, and they suggest that phosphorylation of ecNOS may importantly modulate its activity during the imposition of increased shear stress.},

abstract = {A major breakthrough in neuroscience has been the realization in the last decades that the dogmatic view of astroglial cells as being merely fostering and buffering elements of the nervous system is simplistic. A wealth of investigations now shows that astrocytes actually participate in the control of synaptic transmission in an active manner. This was first hinted by the intimate contacts glial processes make with neurons, particularly at the synaptic level, and evidenced using electrophysiological and calcium imaging techniques. Calcium imaging has provided critical evidence demonstrating that astrocytic regulation of synaptic efficacy is not a passive phenomenon. However, given that cellular activation is not only represented by calcium signaling, it is also crucial to assess concomitant mechanisms. We and others have used electrophysiological techniques to simultaneously record neuronal and astrocytic activity, thus enabling the study of multiple ionic currents and in depth investigation of neuro-glial dialogues. In the current review, we focus on the input such approach has provided in the understanding of astrocyte-neuron interactions underlying control of synaptic efficacy.},

abstract = {Induction of tumor angiogenesis is among the hallmarks of cancer and a driver of metastatic cascade initiation. Recent advances in high-resolution imaging enable highly detailed three-dimensional geometrical representation of the whole-tumor microvascular architecture. This enormous increase in complexity of image-based data necessitates the application of informatics methods for the analysis, mining and reconstruction of these spatial graph data structures. We present a novel methodology that combines ex-vivo high-resolution micro-computed tomography imaging data with a bioimage informatics algorithm to track and reconstruct the whole-tumor vasculature of a human breast cancer model. The reconstructed tumor vascular network is used as an input of a computational model that estimates blood flow in each segment of the tumor microvascular network. This formulation involves a well-established biophysical model and an optimization algorithm that ensures mass balance and detailed monitoring of all the vessels that feed and drain blood from the tumor microvascular network. Perfusion maps for the whole-tumor microvascular network are computed. Morphological and hemodynamic indices from different regions are compared to infer their role in overall tumor perfusion.},

abstract = {In cerebral ischemia survival of neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells is threatened during energy deprivation and/or following re-supply of oxygen and glucose. After a brief summary of characteristics of different cells types, emphasizing the dependence of all on oxidative metabolism, the bioenergetics of focal and global ischemia is discussed, distinguishing between events during energy deprivation and subsequent recovery attempt after re-circulation. Gray and white matter ischemia are described separately, and distinctions are made between mature and immature brains. Next comes a description of bioenergetics in individual cell types in culture during oxygen/glucose deprivation or exposure to metabolic inhibitors and following re-establishment of normal aerated conditions. Due to their expression of NMDA and non-NMDA receptors neurons and oligodendrocytes are exquisitely sensitive to excitotoxicity by glutamate, which reaches high extracellular concentrations in ischemic brain for several reasons, including failing astrocytic uptake. Excitotoxicity kills brain cells by energetic exhaustion (due to Na(+) extrusion after channel-mediated entry) combined with mitochondrial Ca(2+)-mediated injury and formation of reactive oxygen species. Many (but not all) astrocytes survive energy deprivation for extended periods, but after return to aerated conditions they are vulnerable to mitochondrial damage by cytoplasmic/mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload and to NAD(+) deficiency. Ca(2+) overload is established by reversal of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers following Na(+) accumulation during Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter stimulation or pH regulation, compensating for excessive acid production. NAD(+) deficiency inhibits glycolysis and eventually oxidative metabolism, secondary to poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) activity following DNA damage. Hyperglycemia can be beneficial for neurons but increases astrocytic death due to enhanced acidosis.},

abstract = {Vascular endothelium expressing endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) produces nitric oxide (NO), which has a number of important physiological functions in the microvasculature. The rate of NO production by the endothelium is a critical determinant of NO distribution in the vascular wall. We have analyzed the biochemical pathways of NO synthesis and formulated a model to estimate NO production by the microvascular endothelium under physiological conditions. The model quantifies the NO produced by eNOS based on the kinetics of NO synthesis and the availability of eNOS and its intracellular substrates. The predicted NO production from microvessels was in the range of 0.005-0.1 microM/s. This range of predicted values is in agreement with some experimental values but is much lower than other rates previously measured or estimated from experimental data with the help of mathematical modeling. Paradoxical discrepancies between the model predictions and previously reported results based on experimental measurements of NO concentration in the vicinity of the arteriolar wall suggest that NO can also be released through eNOS-independent mechanisms, such as catalysis by neuronal NOS (nNOS). We also used our model to test the sensitivity of NO production to substrate availability, eNOS concentration, and potential rate-limiting factors. The results indicated that the predicted low level of NO production can be attributed primarily to a low expression of eNOS in the microvascular endothelial cells.},

abstract = {The brain is a heterogeneous organ with regionally varied and constantly changing energetic needs. Blood vessels in the brain are equipped with control mechanisms that match oxygen and glucose delivery through blood flow with the local metabolic demands that are imposed by neural activity. However, the cellular bases of this mechanism have remained elusive. A major advance has been the demonstration that astrocytes, cells with extensive contacts with both synapses and cerebral blood vessels, participate in the increases in flow evoked by synaptic activity. Their organization in nonoverlapping spatial domains indicates that they are uniquely positioned to shape the spatial distribution of the vascular responses that are evoked by neural activity. Astrocytic calcium is an important determinant of microvascular function and may regulate flow independently of synaptic activity. The involvement of astrocytes in neurovascular coupling has broad implications for the interpretation of functional imaging signals and for the understanding of brain diseases that are associated with neurovascular dysfunction.},

abstract = {The cloned BK channel alpha subunit from human myometrium was stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, either alone (CHOalpha cells) or in combination with the auxiliary beta subunit (CHOalpha+beta cells). We studied basic channel properties and the effects of cGMP- and cAMP-dependent protein kinases on the BK channel activity. Coexpression of alpha and beta subunits enhanced the Ca2+ and voltage sensitivity of the BK channel, and decreased the inhibitory potency of iberiotoxin. Blocking and stimulating effects on BK channel activity by charybdotoxin and nitric oxide, respectively, were independent of the beta subunit. The cGMP kinase Ialpha and cAMP kinase failed to affect BK channel activity in CHOalpha and CHOalpha+beta cells at different [Ca2+]i and voltages. In contrast, BK channels in freshly isolated myometrial cells from postmenopausal women responded to cAMP kinase and cGMP kinase with a fourfold and twofold decrease in their open probability (NPo), respectively. These effects could be reversed by alkaline phosphatase and remained unaffected by the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (100 nM). In 28\% of myometrial cells, however, cAMP and cGMP kinases increased NPo 2-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively. This stimulation was enhanced rather than reversed by alkaline phosphatase and was abolished by 100 nM okadaic acid. The results suggest that in stably transfected CHO cells the expressed BK channel is not regulated by cAMP kinase and cGMP kinase. However, in native myometrial cells stimulatory and inhibitory regulation of BK channels by cAMP kinase and cGMP kinase was observed, suggesting that channel regulation by the protein kinases requires factors that are not provided by CHO cells. Alternatively, failure of regulation may have been due to the primary structure of the myometrial BK channel protein used in this study.},

abstract = {We outline the mechanisms currently thought to be responsible for controlling cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the physiologic state and during ischemia, focusing on the arterial pial and penetrating microcirculation. Initially, we categorize the cerebral circulation and then review the vascular anatomy. We draw attention to a number of unique features of the cerebral vasculature, which are relevant to the microcirculatory response during ischemia: arterial histology, species differences, collateral flow, the venous drainage, the blood-brain barrier, astrocytes and vascular nerves. The physiology of the arterial microcirculation is then assessed. Lastly, we review the changes during ischemia which impact on the microcirculation. Further understanding of the normal cerebrovascular anatomy and physiology as well as the pathophysiology of ischemia will allow the rational development of a pharmacologic therapy for human stroke and brain injury.},

Age was more strongly associated with gray matter thickness and fractional anisotropy of water diffusion in white matter tracts, while sex was more strongly associated with gray matter surface area. Widespread heritability of neuroanatomic traits was observed, suggesting that brain structure is under strong genetic control. Furthermore, our findings indicate that neuroimaging-based measurements of cerebral variability are sensitive to genetic mediation.

abstract = {The oxygen exchange and correlation between the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) in the cortical capillary levels for normal and pathologic brain functions remain the subject of debate. A 3D realistic mesoscale model of the cortical capillary network (non-tree like) is constructed using a random Voronoi tessellation in which each edge represents a capillary segment. The hemodynamics and oxygen transport are numerically simulated in the model, which involves rheological laws in the capillaries, oxygen diffusion, and non-linear binding of oxygen to hemoglobin, respectively. The findings show that the cerebral hypoxia due to a significant decreased perfusion (as can occur in stroke) can be avoided by a moderate reduction in oxygen demand. Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) can be an important indicator for the brain oxygen metabolism under normal perfusion and misery-perfusion syndrome (leading to ischemia). The results demonstrated that a disproportionately large increase in blood supply is required for a small increase in the oxygen demand, which, in turn, is strongly dependent on the resting OEF. The predicted flow-metabolism coupling in the model supports the experimental studies of spatiotemporal stimulations in humans by positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging.},

abstract = {The cloned BK channel alpha subunit from human myometrium was stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, either alone (CHOalpha cells) or in combination with the auxiliary beta subunit (CHOalpha+beta cells). We studied basic channel properties and the effects of cGMP- and cAMP-dependent protein kinases on the BK channel activity. Coexpression of alpha and beta subunits enhanced the Ca2+ and voltage sensitivity of the BK channel, and decreased the inhibitory potency of iberiotoxin. Blocking and stimulating effects on BK channel activity by charybdotoxin and nitric oxide, respectively, were independent of the beta subunit. The cGMP kinase Ialpha and cAMP kinase failed to affect BK channel activity in CHOalpha and CHOalpha+beta cells at different [Ca2+]i and voltages. In contrast, BK channels in freshly isolated myometrial cells from postmenopausal women responded to cAMP kinase and cGMP kinase with a fourfold and twofold decrease in their open probability (NPo), respectively. These effects could be reversed by alkaline phosphatase and remained unaffected by the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (100 nM). In 28\% of myometrial cells, however, cAMP and cGMP kinases increased NPo 2-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively. This stimulation was enhanced rather than reversed by alkaline phosphatase and was abolished by 100 nM okadaic acid. The results suggest that in stably transfected CHO cells the expressed BK channel is not regulated by cAMP kinase and cGMP kinase. However, in native myometrial cells stimulatory and inhibitory regulation of BK channels by cAMP kinase and cGMP kinase was observed, suggesting that channel regulation by the protein kinases requires factors that are not provided by CHO cells. Alternatively, failure of regulation may have been due to the primary structure of the myometrial BK channel protein used in this study.},

abstract = {The unravelling of the polarized distribution of AQP4 in perivascular astrocytic endfeet has revitalized the interest in the role of astrocytes in controlling water and ion exchange at the brain-blood interface. The importance of the endfeet is based on the premise that they constitute a complete coverage of the vessel wall. Despite a number of studies based on different microscopic techniques this question has yet to be resolved. We have made an electron microscopic 3D reconstruction of perivascular endfeet in CA1 (stratum moleculare) of rat hippocampus. The endfeet interdigitate and overlap, leaving no slits between them. Only in a few sites do processes--tentatively classified as processes of microglia--extend through the perivascular glial sheath to establish direct contact with the endothelial basal lamina. In contrast to the endfoot covering of the endothelial tube, the endfoot covering of the pericyte is incomplete, allowing neuropil elements to touch the basal lamina that enwraps this type of cell. The 3D reconstruction also revealed large bundles of mitochondria in the endfoot processes that came in close apposition to the perivascular endfoot membrane. Our data support the idea that in pathophysiological conditions, the perivascular astrocytic covering may control the exchange of water and solutes between blood and brain and that free diffusion is limited to narrow clefts between overlapping endfeet.},

@article{Lajoix2004,
abstract = {We previously showed that pancreatic beta-cells express a neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) that controls insulin secretion by exerting two enzymatic activities: nitric oxide (NO) production and cytochrome c reductase activity. We now bring evidence that two inhibitors of nNOS, N-omega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) and 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), increase glucose-induced insulin secretion but affect beta-cell function differently. In the presence of l-NAME, insulin response is monophasic, whereas 7-NI preserves the normal biphasic secretory pattern. In addition, the alterations of beta-cell functional response induced by the inhibitors also differ by their sensitivity to a substitutive treatment with sodium nitroprusside, a chemical NO donor. These differences are probably related to the nature of the two inhibitors. Indeed, using low-temperature SDS-PAGE and real-time analysis of nNOS dimerization by surface plasmon resonance, we could show that 7-NI, which competes with arginine and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), an essential cofactor for nNOS dimer formation, inhibits dimerization of the enzyme, whereas the substrate-based inhibitor l-NAME stabilizes the homodimeric state of nNOS. The latter effect could be reproduced by the two endogenous inhibitors of NOS, N-omega-methyl-l-arginine and asymmetric dimethylarginine, and resulted interestingly in a reduced ability of the protein inhibitor of nNOS (PIN) to dissociate nNOS dimers. We conclude that intracellular factors able to induce abnormalities in the nNOS monomer/dimer equilibrium could lead to pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction.},

Recent advances in high-resolution imaging enable highly detailed three-dimensional geometrical representation of the whole-tumor microvascular architecture. This enormous increase in complexity of image-based data necessitates the application of informatics methods for the analysis, mining and reconstruction of these spatial graph data structures. We present a novel methodology that combines ex-vivo high-resolution micro-computed tomography imaging data with a bioimage informatics algorithm to track and reconstruct the whole-tumor vasculature of a human breast cancer model. The reconstructed tumor vascular network is used as an input of a computational model that estimates blood flow in each segment of the tumor microvascular network. This formulation involves a well-established biophysical model and an optimization algorithm that ensures mass balance and detailed monitoring of all the vessels that feed and drain blood from the tumor microvascular network. Perfusion maps for the whole-tumor microvascular network are computed. Morphological and hemodynamic indices from different regions are compared to infer their role in overall tumor perfusion.},

abstract = {During saccadic motion the eyewall moves in a manner similar to a sinusoid or at least can be represented by a sine Fourier series. Motion of the vitreous is induced by the saccade and the vitreo-retinal interface is subjected to a time-dependent shear. This force may be a significant factor for retinal tearing in the neighbourhood of small retinal holes or tears. An analytical viscoelastic model and a numerical, Newtonian model of the motion of the vitreous are presented and compared. Under sinusoidal boundary motion the analytical model shows that a viscous wave propagates inward toward the axis of rotation and the characteristic length of this wave is a function of the Womersley number. The numerical solution indicates that the vitreous moves similarly to the analytical result with small secondary motion; however, this motion allows complete recirculation of the vitreous over large timescales. Excellent agreement is found between the analytical and numerical models. The time-dependent fluid shear is evaluated and from the analytical solution the maximum value of this is found to be proportional to R0 square root of v(omega)3, where R0 is the eye radius, v the modified complex viscosity and omega the sinusoidal frequency. This indicates that myopes have a larger shear force exerted on them by virtue of the larger eye size. Further work is directed toward a model which links the stress found in the sclera to that exerted on the vitreo-retinal interface by the vitreous fluid motion.},

We perform Bayesian Flux Balance Analysis (BFBA) with a new mathematical model of cellular brain energetics, comprising detailed biochemical pathways in and between astrocytes and glutamatergic neurons and partitioning of each cell type into cytosol and mitochondria. Supported by the results of our in silico studies, which are in remarkable agreement with previously published results, we posit the Glucose Shunt Hypothesis (GSH) that during high activity, the inhibition of the phosphofructokinase (PFK) enzyme in neuron impairs neuronal glycolysis, enabling the process by which lactate effluxed by astrocytes is taken up by glutamatergic neurons, whereas at low activity, glucose remains the preferred substrate for neurons. We postulate that the ANLS is a shunt utilized by glutamatergic neurons to bypass their glycolysis impaired by the inhibition of PFK in connection with increased oxidative phosphorylation at high neuronal activity.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) are well established as messenger molecules throughout the body, gasotransmitters, based on striking alterations in mice lacking the appropriate biosynthetic enzymes. Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is even more chemically reactive, but until recently there was little definitive evidence for its physiologic formation. Cystathionine beta-synthase (EC 4.2.1.22), and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE; EC 4.4.1.1), also known as cystathionine, can generate H(2)S from cyst(e)ine. Very recent studies with mice lacking these enzymes have established that CSE is responsible for H(2)S formation in the periphery, while in the brain cystathionine beta-synthase is the biosynthetic enzyme. Endothelial-derived relaxing factor activity is reduced 80\% in the mesenteric artery of mice with deletion of CSE, establishing H(2)S as a major physiologic endothelial-derived relaxing factor. H(2)S appears to signal predominantly by S-sulfhydrating cysteines in its target proteins, analogous to S-nitrosylation by NO. Whereas S-nitrosylation typically inhibits enzymes, S-sulfhydration activates them. S-nitrosylation basally affects 1-2\% of its target proteins, while 10-25\% of H(2)S target proteins are S-sulfhydrated. In summary, H(2)S appears to be a physiologic gasotransmitter of comparable importance to NO and carbon monoxide.},

abstract = {Functional hyperemia is an important metabolic autoregulation mechanism by which increased neuronal activity is matched by a rapid and regional increase in blood supply. This mechanism is facilitated by a process known as "neurovascular coupling"--the orchestrated communication system involving neurons, astrocytes and arterioles. Important steps in this process are the production of EETs in the astrocyte and the release of potassium, via two potassium channels (BK and KIR), into the perivascular space. We provide a model which successfully accounts for several observations seen in experiment. The model is capable of simulating the approximate 15\% arteriolar dilation caused by a 60-s neuronal activation (modelled as a release of potassium and glutamate into the synaptic cleft). This model also successfully emulates the paradoxical experimental finding that vasoconstriction follows vasodilation when the astrocytic calcium concentration (or perivascular potassium concentration) is increased further. We suggest that the interaction of the changing smooth muscle cell membrane potential and the changing potassium-dependent resting potential of the KIR channel are responsible for this effect. Finally, we demonstrate that a well-controlled mechanism of potassium buffering is potentially important for successful neurovascular coupling.},

Studies on single, isolated arterioles in vitro were initiated to examine more closely the validity of this explanation for regional response differences. This paper reports some of the results. First-, second-, and third-order arterioles (18-60 micron i.d.) were dissected from hamster cheek pouches. The vessels were cannulated with a modified Burg microperfusion system, and their mechanical properties studied using the methods described by Duling and Gore. Vessels were activated in four stages with K+ and norepinephrine. During activation, transmural pressures were adjusted to minimize vascular smooth-muscle shortening. Active pressure-diameter curves were recorded while adjusting transmural pressure through the range 5 to 400 cm H20 in 5-25 cm steps. Vessel dimensions were measured with a videomicrometer. Passive curves were obtained after equilibration overnight in Ca2+-free medium. The vessels were then fixed and prepared for histologic sectioning, and measurements of vessel-wall composition were made. The Laplace relationship was used to construct length-tension diagrams, and the histologic data were used to normalize the dimensional data to smooth-muscle lengths. Maximum active tension of second-order arterioles (1,170 dynes/cm) was two times previous values reported by Gore et al. This was due presumably to refinements in techniques and dissection procedures. Maximum active stress averaged 3.9 X 10(+6) dynes/cm2 for second-order arterioles. This number is identical to data obtained from hog carotid strips by Dillon et al.},

abstract = {Understanding the link between neuronal responses (NRs) and metabolic signals is fundamental to our knowledge of brain function and it is a milestone in our efforts to interpret data from modern non invasive optical techniques such as fMRI, which are based on the close coupling between metabolic demand of active neurons and local changes in blood flow. The challenge is to unravel the link. Here we show, using spectrophotometry to record oxyhaemoglobin and methemoglobin (surrogate markers of cerebral flow and nitric oxide levels respectively) together with extracellular neuronal recordings in vivo and applying a multiple polynomial regression model, that the markers are able to predict up about 80\% of variability in NR. Furthermore, we show that the coupling between blood flow and neuronal activity is heavily influenced by nitric oxide (NO). While NRs show the typical saturating response, blood flow shows a linear behaviour during contrast-response curves, with nitric oxide from different sources acting differently for low and high intensity.},

abstract = {Low nanomolar concentrations of nitric oxide activate guanylyl cyclase to produce cGMP, which has diverse physiological effects. Higher concentrations inhibit mitochondrial respiration at cytochrome c oxidase and this has been proposed to be important physiologically, increasing oxygen permeation into tissue (by reducing the oxygen use of cells near blood vessels), activating AMP kinase, and regulating the relationship between cerebral blood flow and oxygen use. It is unclear, however, whether nitric oxide can accumulate physiologically to concentrations at which inhibition of respiration occurs. In rat cerebellar slices, we activated nitric oxide production from each isoform of nitric oxide synthase. Only activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase, which is expressed pathologically, caused any significant inhibition of respiration. Modelling oxygen and nitric oxide concentrations predicted that, in vivo, physiological nitric oxide levels are too low to affect respiration. Even pathologically, the nitric oxide concentration may only rise to 2.5 nm, producing a 1.5\% inhibition of respiration. Thus, under physiological conditions, nitric oxide signals do not inhibit respiration but are well-tuned to the dynamic range of guanylyl cyclase activation.},

abstract = {Moment-to-moment changes in local neuronal activity lead to dynamic changes in cerebral blood flow. Emerging evidence implicates astrocytes as one of the key players in coordinating this neurovascular coupling. Astrocytes are poised to sense glutamatergic synaptic activity over a large spatial domain via activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors and subsequent calcium signaling and via energy-dependent glutamate transport. Astrocyte foot processes can signal vascular smooth muscle by arachidonic acid pathways involving astrocytic cytochrome P450 epoxygenase, astrocytic cyclooxygenase-1 and smooth muscle cytochrome P450 omega-hydroxylase activities, and by astrocytic and smooth muscle potassium channels. Non-glutamatergic transmitters released from neurons, such as nitric oxide, cyclooxygenase-2 metabolites and vasoactive intestinal peptide, might modulate neurovascular signaling at the level of the astrocyte or smooth muscle. Thus, astrocytes have a pivotal role in dynamic signaling within the neurovascular unit. Important questions remain on how this signaling is integrated with other pathways in health and disease.},

abstract = {A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach was presented to model the blood flows in the carotid bifurcation and the brain arteries under altered gravity. Physical models required for CFD simulation were introduced including a model for arterial wall motion due to fluid-wall interactions, a shear thinning fluid model of blood, a vascular bed model for outflow boundary conditions, and a model for autoregulation mechanism. The three-dimensional unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled with these models were solved iteratively using the pseudocompressibility method and dual time stepping. Gravity source terms were added to the Navier-Stokes equations to take the effect of gravity into account. For the treatment of complex geometry, a chimera overset grid technique was adopted to obtain connectivity between arterial branches. For code validation, computed results were compared with experimental data for both steady-state and time-dependent flows. This computational approach was then applied to blood flows through a realistic carotid bifurcation and two Circle of Willis models, one using an idealized geometry and the other using an anatomical data set. A three-dimensional Circle of Willis configuration was reconstructed from subject-specific magnetic resonance images using an image segmentation method. Through the numerical simulation of blood flow in two model problems, namely, the carotid bifurcation and the brain arteries, it was observed that the altered gravity has considerable effects on arterial contraction/dilatation and consequent changes in flow conditions.},

abstract = {Calcium signaling in C6 glioma cells in culture was examined with digital fluorescence video microscopy. C6 cells express low levels of the gap junction protein connexin43 and have correspondingly weak gap junctional communication as evidenced by dye coupling (Naus, C. C. G., J. F. Bechberger, S. Caveney, and J. X. Wilson. 1991. Neurosci. Lett. 126:33-36). Transfection of C6 cells with the cDNA encoding connexin43 resulted in clones with increased expression of connexin43 mRNA and protein and increased dye coupling, as well as markedly reduced rates of proliferation (Zhu, D., S. Caveney, G. M. Kidder, and C. C. Naus. 1991. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 88:1883-1887; Naus, C. C. G., D. Zhu, S. Todd, and G. M. Kidder. 1992. Cell Mol. Neurobiol. 12:163-175). Mechanical stimulation of a single cell in a culture of non-transfected C6 cells induced a wave of increased intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) that showed little or no communication to adjacent cells. By contrast, mechanical stimulation of a single cell in cultures of C6 clones expressing transfected connexin43 cDNA induced a Ca2+ wave that was communicated to multiple surrounding cells, and the extent of communication was proportional to the level of expression of the connexin43 cDNA. These results provide direct evidence that intercellular Ca2+ signaling occurs via gap junctions. Ca2+ signaling through gap junctions may provide a means for the coordinated regulation of cellular function, including cell growth and differentiation.},

abstract = {We developed a new technique to estimate the aortic pressure (AP) waveform from a single peripheral artery pressure (PAP) waveform. The technique 1) employs a parallel tube model of the arterial tree to establish a transfer function relating PAP to AP with unknown parameters; 2) estimates the parameters from the measured PAP waveform, along with a single non-invasive measurement of the wave transmission delay from the aorta to the peripheral artery measurement site, by exploiting the fact that aortic flow is zero during diastole; and 3) applies the transfer function to the PAP waveform to predict the unmeasured AP waveform. In this way, in contrast to the conventional generalized transfer function paradigm, the transfer function is able to adapt to the inter-subject and temporal variability of the arterial tree. We applied this adaptive transfer function technique to PAP waveforms measured from five dogs instrumented with reference AP catheters during various hemodynamic interventions. Our results showed that the technique was able to reliably estimate the AP waveform with an overall error of 4.2 mmHg. For comparison, the corresponding errors of two previously proposed generalized transfer functions trained on a subset of the same canine data were, on average, 19\% larger.},

abstract = {A mathematical account is given of the processes governing the time courses of calcium ions (Ca2+), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in single cells following the application of external agonist to metabotropic receptors. A model is constructed that incorporates the regulation of metabotropic receptor activity, the G-protein cascade and the Ca2+ dynamics in the cytosol. It is subsequently used to reproduce observations on the extent of desensitization and sequestration of the P2Y2 receptor following its activation by uridine triphosphate (UTP). The theory predicts the dependence on agonist concentration of the change in the number of receptors in the membrane as well as the time course of disappearance of receptors from the plasmalemma, upon exposure to agonist. In addition, the extent of activation and desensitization of the receptor, using the calcium transients in cells initiated by exposure to agonist, is also predicted. Model predictions show the significance of membrane PIP2 depletion and resupply on the time course of IP3 and Ca2+ levels. Results of the modelling also reveal the importance of receptor recycling and PIP2 resupply for maintaining Ca2+ and IP3 levels during sustained application of agonist. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Cardiol. 92:59-61) has been proposed to be a regulator of calcium homeostasis and signal transduction networks of the cell. However, little is known about its precise mechanisms of action. Knock-out of (mainly neuronal) isoform 2 of the enzyme resulted in hearing loss and balance deficits due to severe inner ear defects, affecting formation and maintenance of otoconia (Kozel, P.J., R.A. Friedman, L.C. Erway, E.N. Yamoah, L.H. Liu, T. Riddle, J.J. Duffy, T. Doetschman, M.L. Miller, E.L. Cardell, and G.E. Shull. 1998. J. Biol. Chem. 273:18693-18696). Here we demonstrate that PMCA 4b is a negative regulator of nitric oxide synthase I (NOS-I, nNOS) in HEK293 embryonic kidney and neuro-2a neuroblastoma cell models. Binding of PMCA 4b to NOS-I was mediated by interaction of the COOH-terminal amino acids of PMCA 4b and the PDZ domain of NOS-I (PDZ: PSD 95/Dlg/ZO-1 protein domain). Increasing expression of wild-type PMCA 4b (but not PMCA mutants unable to bind PDZ domains or devoid of Ca2+-transporting activity) dramatically downregulated NO synthesis from wild-type NOS-I. A NOS-I mutant lacking the PDZ domain was not regulated by PMCA, demonstrating the specific nature of the PMCA-NOS-I interaction. Elucidation of PMCA as an interaction partner and major regulator of NOS-I provides evidence for a new dimension of integration between calcium and NO signaling pathways.},

abstract = {Throughout the history of research on stroke pathophysiology, focus has shifted from purely vascular concepts to the insight that a complex interplay of biochemical and molecular mechanisms involving practically any cell type of the brain ("neurovascular unit") partakes in either salvage or demise of the tissue after a stroke. In addition, it was realized that peripheral immune cells play important roles, not only after their invasion into the brain but also because of stroke-induced effects on the immune system that can result in infections. Indeed, outcome of stroke patients is not only dictated by nonmodifiable factors, such as severity of stroke, age, or premorbidity, but also by modifiable factors largely related to medical complications, such as infections and possibly sarcopenia. The highly successful concept of stroke units attests to the benefits of treating stroke comprehensively. Breakthroughs in improving outcome after stroke will only result from approaches that target not only the brain, but also systemic effects of stroke.},

Initially, we categorize the cerebral circulation and then review the vascular anatomy. We draw attention to a number of unique features of the cerebral vasculature, which are relevant to the microcirculatory response during ischemia: arterial histology, species differences, collateral flow, the venous drainage, the blood-brain barrier, astrocytes and vascular nerves. The physiology of the arterial microcirculation is then assessed. Lastly, we review the changes during ischemia which impact on the microcirculation. Further understanding of the normal cerebrovascular anatomy and physiology as well as the pathophysiology of ischemia will allow the rational development of a pharmacologic therapy for human stroke and brain injury.},

abstract = {Vascular dysfunction has a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent data from brain imaging studies in humans and animal models suggest that cerebrovascular dysfunction may precede cognitive decline and onset of neurodegenerative changes in AD and AD models. Cerebral hypoperfusion and impaired amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) clearance across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may contribute to the onset and progression of dementia AD type. Decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) negatively affects the synthesis of proteins required for memory and learning, and may eventually lead to neuritic injury and neuronal death. Impaired clearance of Abeta from the brain by the cells of the neurovascular unit may lead to its accumulation on blood vessels and in brain parenchyma. The accumulation of Abeta on the cerebral blood vessels, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is associated with cognitive decline and is one of the hallmarks of AD pathology. CAA can severely disrupt the integrity of the blood vessel wall resulting in micro or macro intracerebral bleedings that exacerbates neurodegenerative process and inflammatory response and may lead to hemorrhagic stroke, respectively. Here, we review the role of the neurovascular unit and molecular mechanisms in vascular cells behind AD and CAA pathogenesis. First, we discuss apparent vascular changes, including the cerebral hypoperfusion and vascular degeneration that contribute to different stages of the disease process in AD individuals. We next discuss the role of the low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP), a key Abeta clearance receptor at the BBB and along the cerebrovascular system, whose expression is suppressed early in AD. We also discuss how brain-derived apolipoprotein E isoforms may influence Abeta clearance across the BBB. We then review the role of two interacting transcription factors, myocardin and serum response factor, in cerebral vascular cells in controlling CBF responses and LRP-mediated Abeta clearance. Finally, we discuss the role of microglia and perivascular macrophages in Abeta clearance from the brain. The data reviewed here support an essential role of neurovascular and BBB mechanisms in contributing to both, onset and progression of AD.},

abstract = {Administration of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) frequently results in vasoconstriction that is primarily attributed to the scavenging of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) by cell-free hemoglobin. The ensuing pressor response could be caused by the high NO reactivity of HBOC in the vascular lumen and/or the extravasation of hemoglobin molecules. There is a need for quantitative understanding of the NO interaction with HBOC in the blood vessels. We developed a detailed mathematical model of NO diffusion and reaction in the presence of an HBOC for an arteriolar-size vessel. The HBOC reactivity with NO and degree of extravasation was studied in the range of 2-58 x 10(6) M(-1) x s(-1) and 0-100\%, respectively. The model predictions showed that the addition of HBOC reduced the smooth muscle (SM) NO concentration in the activation range (12-28 nM) for soluble guanylate cyclase, a major determinant of SM contraction. The SM NO concentration was significantly reduced when the extravasation of HBOC molecules was considered. The myoglobin present in the parenchymal cells scavenges NO, which reduces the SM NO concentration.},

@article{Bolz2003,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: NO-induced dilations in resistance arteries (RAs) are not associated with decreases in vascular smooth muscle cell Ca2+. We tested whether a cGMP-dependent activation of the smooth muscle myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) resulting in a Ca2+ desensitization of the contractile apparatus was the underlying mechanism and whether it could be antagonized by the RhoA pathway.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The Ca2+ sensitivity of RA was assessed as the relation between changes in diameter and [Ca2+]i in depolarized RA (120 mol/L K+) exposed to stepwise increases in Ca2+ex (0 to 3 mmol/L). Effects of 10 micromol/L sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on Ca2+ sensitivity were determined before and after application of the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ (1 micromol/L) and the MLCP inhibitor calyculin A (120 nmol/L) and in presence of the RhoA-activating phospholipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P, 12 nmol/L). SNP-induced dilations were also studied in controls and in RAs pretreated with the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 or transfected with a dominant-negative RhoA mutant (N19RhoA). Constrictions elicited by increasing Ca2+ex were significantly attenuated by SNP, which, however, left associated increases in [Ca2+]i unaffected. This NO-induced attenuation was blocked by ODQ, calyculin A, and S1P. The S1P-induced translocation of RhoA indicating activation of the GTPase was not reversed by SNP. Inhibition of RhoA/Rho kinase by N19RhoA or Y27632 significantly augmented SNP-induced dilations.

CONCLUSIONS: NO dilates RA by activating the MLCP in a cGMP-dependent manner, thereby reducing the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus. MLCP inactivation via the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway antagonizes this Ca2+-desensitizing effect that, in turn, can be restored using RhoA/Rho kinase inhibitors.},

abstract = {Astrocytes are considered the third component of the synapse, responding to neurotransmitter release from synaptic terminals and releasing gliotransmitters--including glutamate--in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner to affect neuronal synaptic activity. Many studies reporting astrocyte-driven neuronal activity have evoked astrocyte Ca(2+) increases by application of endogenous ligands that directly activate neuronal receptors, making astrocyte contribution to neuronal effect(s) difficult to determine. We have made transgenic mice that express a Gq-coupled receptor only in astrocytes to evoke astrocyte Ca(2+) increases using an agonist that does not bind endogenous receptors in brain. By recording from CA1 pyramidal cells in acute hippocampal slices from these mice, we demonstrate that widespread Ca(2+) elevations in 80\%-90\% of stratum radiatum astrocytes do not increase neuronal Ca(2+), produce neuronal slow inward currents, or affect excitatory synaptic activity. Our findings call into question the developing consensus that Ca(2+)-dependent glutamate release by astrocytes directly affects neuronal synaptic activity in situ.},

The structure and function of the BBB is summarised, the physical barrier formed by the endothelial tight junctions, and the transport barrier resulting from membrane transporters and vesicular mechanisms. The roles of associated cells are outlined, especially the endfeet of astrocytic glial cells, and pericytes and microglia. The embryonic development of the BBB, and changes in pathology are described. The BBB is subject to short and long-term regulation, which may be disturbed in pathology. Any programme for drug discovery or delivery, to target or avoid the CNS, needs to consider the special features of the BBB.},

abstract = {Intracranial pressure (ICP) is affected in many neurological conditions. Clinical measurement of pressure on the brain currently requires placing a probe in the cerebrospinal fluid compartment, the brain tissue, or other intracranial space. This invasiveness limits the measurement to critically ill patients. Because ICP is also clinically important in conditions ranging from brain tumors and hydrocephalus to concussions, noninvasive determination of ICP would be desirable. Our model-based approach to continuous estimation and tracking of ICP uses routinely obtainable time-synchronized, noninvasive (or minimally invasive) measurements of peripheral arterial blood pressure and blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCA), both at intra-heartbeat resolution. A physiological model of cerebrovascular dynamics provides mathematical constraints that relate the measured waveforms to ICP. Our algorithm produces patient-specific ICP estimates with no calibration or training. Using 35 hours of data from 37 patients with traumatic brain injury, we generated ICP estimates on 2665 nonoverlapping 60-beat data windows. Referenced against concurrently recorded invasive parenchymal ICP that varied over 100 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) across all records, our estimates achieved a mean error (bias) of 1.6 mmHg and SD of error (SDE) of 7.6 mmHg. For the 1673 data windows over 22 hours in which blood flow velocity recordings were available from both the left and the right MCA, averaging the resulting bilateral ICP estimates reduced the bias to 1.5 mmHg and SDE to 5.9 mmHg. This accuracy is already comparable to that of some invasive ICP measurement methods in current clinical use.},

abstract = {Astrocytes comprise approximately half of the volume of the adult mammalian brain and are the primary neuronal structural and trophic supportive elements. Astrocytes are organized into distinct nonoverlapping domains and extend elaborate and dense fine processes that interact intimately with synapses and cerebrovasculature. The recognition in the mid 1990s that astrocytes undergo elevations in intracellular calcium concentration following activation of G protein-coupled receptors by synaptically released neurotransmitters demonstrated not only that astrocytes display a form of excitability but also that astrocytes may be active participants in brain information processing. The roles that astrocytic calcium elevations play in neurophysiology and especially in modulation of neuronal activity have been intensely researched in recent years. This review will summarize the current understanding of the function of astrocytic calcium signaling in neurophysiological processes and discuss areas where the role of astrocytes remains controversial and will therefore benefit from further study.},

WIT003, ABSA and 20-HETE all had a similar effect to reduce the diameter of the middle cerebral artery by 26\%. WIT003 and 20-HETE both increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from the middle cerebral artery. In contrast, WIT002 had no effect on the basal diameter of the middle cerebral artery but it attenuated the vasoconstrictor responses and the rise in [Ca2+]i in vascular smooth muscle cells following administration of 20-HETE and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). WIT003 partially restored the vasoconstrictor response to 5-HT in the middle cerebral artery after administration of an inhibitor of the endogenous synthesis of 20-HETE. Infusion of the 20-HETE agonists, WIT003 and ABSA, into cisterna magna of rats reduced baseline cerebral blood flow by 20\%, whereas administration of the 20-HETE antagonist, WIT002, had no effect. Intracisternal injection of WIT002 attenuated the fall in cerebral blood flow following injection of blood into the cisterna magna, whereas administration of the 20-HETE agonist, ABSA, potentiated this response. These findings indicate that the 20-HETE agonists, WIT003 and ABSA, increase cerebral vascular tone both in vivo and in vitro and suggest blocking the vasoconstrictor actions of 20-HETE may be useful to prevent the acute fall in cerebral blood flow following subarachnoid hemorrhage.},

abstract = {Functional hyperemia is an important metabolic autoregulation mechanism by which increased neuronal activity is matched by a rapid and regional increase in blood supply. This mechanism is facilitated by a process known as "neurovascular coupling"--the orchestrated communication system involving neurons, astrocytes and arterioles. Important steps in this process are the production of EETs in the astrocyte and the release of potassium, via two potassium channels (BK and KIR), into the perivascular space. We provide a model which successfully accounts for several observations seen in experiment. The model is capable of simulating the approximate 15\% arteriolar dilation caused by a 60-s neuronal activation (modelled as a release of potassium and glutamate into the synaptic cleft). This model also successfully emulates the paradoxical experimental finding that vasoconstriction follows vasodilation when the astrocytic calcium concentration (or perivascular potassium concentration) is increased further. We suggest that the interaction of the changing smooth muscle cell membrane potential and the changing potassium-dependent resting potential of the KIR channel are responsible for this effect. Finally, we demonstrate that a well-controlled mechanism of potassium buffering is potentially important for successful neurovascular coupling.},

Here, I propose the neurovascular hypothesis of AD, suggesting that faulty clearance of amyloid beta peptide (A beta) across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), aberrant angiogenesis and senescence of the cerebrovascular system could initiate neurovascular uncoupling, vessel regression, brain hypoperfusion and neurovascular inflammation. Ultimately, this would lead to BBB compromise, to chemical imbalance in the neuronal environment and to synaptic and neuronal dysfunction, injury and loss. Based on the neurovascular hypothesis, I suggest an array of new potential therapeutic approaches that could be developed for AD, to enhance A beta clearance and neurovascular repair, and to protect the neurovascular unit from divergent inducers of injury and apoptosis.},

abstract = {While a range of cellular mechanisms have been proposed to underlie control of neurovascular coupling, a comprehensive, reconciliatory model has yet to be determined. To fit with such a model, it is essential that candidate mechanisms exhibit reaction times, spatial ranges, and speeds of propagation that are consistent with the vascular manifestations of the 'hemodynamic response'. Understanding these vascular dynamics is therefore a critical step towards developing a robust model of neurovascular coupling. In this study, we utilize high-speed optical imaging of exposed rodent somatosensory cortex to explore and characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface vessels during functional hyperemia. Our high-speed, high-resolution optical imaging approach allows us to study the hemodynamic response independently in individual vessels, and in discrete regions of the parenchyma with enough resolution to precisely characterize subtle spatial and temporal features of the response. Specifically, we explore when and where the first hemodynamic changes occur in response to stimuli, the direction and speed at which these changes propagate in arterioles and regions of the parenchyma, and the relative timing at which each of these compartments returns to its original baseline state. From these results, we are able to conclude that the hemodynamic response appears to initiate in the parenchyma and then spreads rapidly to surface arterioles. Following the initial onset we find evidence that the response spreads spatially outwards via the dilation of targeted arterioles. This propagation of vasodilation is independent of the direction of blood flow within each arteriole. We also find evidence of a decay phase that acts with a more uniform spatial dependence, rather than along targeted vessels, causing the periphery of the responding region to return to baseline first. We hypothesize that different underlying cellular mechanisms/signaling pathways are responsible for the response initiation and the response decay. Our results advance the fundamental understanding of the hemodynamic response, as well as our ability to evaluate potential cellular mechanisms for their involvement in neurovascular coupling.},

abstract = {In vivo studies on frog mesenteric arterioles (4) indicate that segmental differences in the response of microvessels to physical and chemical stimuli can be explained simply in terms of the length-tension characteristics of vascular smooth muscle at different points along the vascular tree. Studies on single, isolated arterioles in vitro were initiated to examine more closely the validity of this explanation for regional response differences. This paper reports some of the results. First-, second-, and third-order arterioles (18-60 micron i.d.) were dissected from hamster cheek pouches. The vessels were cannulated with a modified Burg microperfusion system, and their mechanical properties studied using the methods described by Duling and Gore. Vessels were activated in four stages with K+ and norepinephrine. During activation, transmural pressures were adjusted to minimize vascular smooth-muscle shortening. Active pressure-diameter curves were recorded while adjusting transmural pressure through the range 5 to 400 cm H20 in 5-25 cm steps. Vessel dimensions were measured with a videomicrometer. Passive curves were obtained after equilibration overnight in Ca2+-free medium. The vessels were then fixed and prepared for histologic sectioning, and measurements of vessel-wall composition were made. The Laplace relationship was used to construct length-tension diagrams, and the histologic data were used to normalize the dimensional data to smooth-muscle lengths. Maximum active tension of second-order arterioles (1,170 dynes/cm) was two times previous values reported by Gore et al. This was due presumably to refinements in techniques and dissection procedures. Maximum active stress averaged 3.9 X 10(+6) dynes/cm2 for second-order arterioles. This number is identical to data obtained from hog carotid strips by Dillon et al.},

abstract = {The unravelling of the polarized distribution of AQP4 in perivascular astrocytic endfeet has revitalized the interest in the role of astrocytes in controlling water and ion exchange at the brain-blood interface. The importance of the endfeet is based on the premise that they constitute a complete coverage of the vessel wall. Despite a number of studies based on different microscopic techniques this question has yet to be resolved. We have made an electron microscopic 3D reconstruction of perivascular endfeet in CA1 (stratum moleculare) of rat hippocampus. The endfeet interdigitate and overlap, leaving no slits between them. Only in a few sites do processes--tentatively classified as processes of microglia--extend through the perivascular glial sheath to establish direct contact with the endothelial basal lamina. In contrast to the endfoot covering of the endothelial tube, the endfoot covering of the pericyte is incomplete, allowing neuropil elements to touch the basal lamina that enwraps this type of cell. The 3D reconstruction also revealed large bundles of mitochondria in the endfoot processes that came in close apposition to the perivascular endfoot membrane. Our data support the idea that in pathophysiological conditions, the perivascular astrocytic covering may control the exchange of water and solutes between blood and brain and that free diffusion is limited to narrow clefts between overlapping endfeet.},

abstract = {Calcium signaling in C6 glioma cells in culture was examined with digital fluorescence video microscopy. C6 cells express low levels of the gap junction protein connexin43 and have correspondingly weak gap junctional communication as evidenced by dye coupling (Naus, C. C. G., J. F. Bechberger, S. Caveney, and J. X. Wilson. 1991. Neurosci. Lett. 126:33-36). Transfection of C6 cells with the cDNA encoding connexin43 resulted in clones with increased expression of connexin43 mRNA and protein and increased dye coupling, as well as markedly reduced rates of proliferation (Zhu, D., S. Caveney, G. M. Kidder, and C. C. Naus. 1991. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 88:1883-1887; Naus, C. C. G., D. Zhu, S. Todd, and G. M. Kidder. 1992. Cell Mol. Neurobiol. 12:163-175). Mechanical stimulation of a single cell in a culture of non-transfected C6 cells induced a wave of increased intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) that showed little or no communication to adjacent cells. By contrast, mechanical stimulation of a single cell in cultures of C6 clones expressing transfected connexin43 cDNA induced a Ca2+ wave that was communicated to multiple surrounding cells, and the extent of communication was proportional to the level of expression of the connexin43 cDNA. These results provide direct evidence that intercellular Ca2+ signaling occurs via gap junctions. Ca2+ signaling through gap junctions may provide a means for the coordinated regulation of cellular function, including cell growth and differentiation.},

abstract = {In cerebral ischemia survival of neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells is threatened during energy deprivation and/or following re-supply of oxygen and glucose. After a brief summary of characteristics of different cells types, emphasizing the dependence of all on oxidative metabolism, the bioenergetics of focal and global ischemia is discussed, distinguishing between events during energy deprivation and subsequent recovery attempt after re-circulation. Gray and white matter ischemia are described separately, and distinctions are made between mature and immature brains. Next comes a description of bioenergetics in individual cell types in culture during oxygen/glucose deprivation or exposure to metabolic inhibitors and following re-establishment of normal aerated conditions. Due to their expression of NMDA and non-NMDA receptors neurons and oligodendrocytes are exquisitely sensitive to excitotoxicity by glutamate, which reaches high extracellular concentrations in ischemic brain for several reasons, including failing astrocytic uptake. Excitotoxicity kills brain cells by energetic exhaustion (due to Na(+) extrusion after channel-mediated entry) combined with mitochondrial Ca(2+)-mediated injury and formation of reactive oxygen species. Many (but not all) astrocytes survive energy deprivation for extended periods, but after return to aerated conditions they are vulnerable to mitochondrial damage by cytoplasmic/mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload and to NAD(+) deficiency. Ca(2+) overload is established by reversal of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers following Na(+) accumulation during Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter stimulation or pH regulation, compensating for excessive acid production. NAD(+) deficiency inhibits glycolysis and eventually oxidative metabolism, secondary to poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) activity following DNA damage. Hyperglycemia can be beneficial for neurons but increases astrocytic death due to enhanced acidosis.},

abstract = {Neural activities trigger regional vasodilation in the brain. Diffusible messengers such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostanoids are considered to work as vasodilators in neurovascular coupling. However, their roles are still controversial. In the present study, cortical images of neural activities and vasodilation were recorded through the intact skull of C57BL/6 mice anesthetized with urethane. Flavoprotein fluorescence responses elicited by vibratory hindpaw stimulation were followed by darkening of arteriole images reflecting vasodilation in the somatosensory cortex. Vasodilation was also observed in light reflection images at the wavelength of 570 nm in the same mice. We perfused the surface of the cortex under the skull with 100 $\mu$M NG-nitro-l-arginine (l-NA), an inhibitor of NO synthase (NOS), and 10 $\mu$M indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX). These drugs suppressed vasodilation without changing flavoprotein fluorescence responses. A mixture of l-NA and indomethacin almost completely eliminated vasodilation. In mice lacking neuronal NOS (nNOS), activity-dependent vasodilation was significantly suppressed compared with that in littermate control mice, while that in mice lacking cytosolic phospholipase A2 $\alpha$ (cPLA2$\alpha$) was unchanged. These results indicate that NO works as a vasodilator in neurovascular coupling of the mouse somatosensory cortex. © 2007.},

Astrocytes are organized into distinct nonoverlapping domains and extend elaborate and dense fine processes that interact intimately with synapses and cerebrovasculature. The recognition in the mid 1990s that astrocytes undergo elevations in intracellular calcium concentration following activation of G protein-coupled receptors by synaptically released neurotransmitters demonstrated not only that astrocytes display a form of excitability but also that astrocytes may be active participants in brain information processing. The roles that astrocytic calcium elevations play in neurophysiology and especially in modulation of neuronal activity have been intensely researched in recent years. This review will summarize the current understanding of the function of astrocytic calcium signaling in neurophysiological processes and discuss areas where the role of astrocytes remains controversial and will therefore benefit from further study.},

abstract = {In a variety of cells, hormonal or neurotransmitter signals elicit a train of intracellular Ca2+ spikes. The analysis of a minimal model based on Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores shows how sustained oscillations of cytosolic Ca2+ may develop as a result of a rise in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) triggered by external stimulation. This rise elicits the release of a certain amount of Ca2+ from an InsP3-sensitive intracellular store. The subsequent rise in cytosolic Ca2+ in turn triggers the release of Ca2+ from a second store insensitive to InsP3. In contrast to the model proposed by Meyer and Stryer [Meyer, T. \& Stryer, L. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 5051-5055], the present model, which contains only two variables, predicts the occurrence of periodic Ca2+ spikes in the absence of InsP3 oscillations. Such results indicate that repetitive Ca2+ spikes evoked by external stimuli do not necessarily require the concomitant, periodic variation of InsP3. The model is closely related to that proposed by Kuba and Takeshita [Kuba, K. \& Takeshita, S. (1981) J. Theor. Biol. 93, 1009-1031] for Ca2+ oscillations in sympathetic neurones, based on Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ release. We extend their results by showing the minimal conditions in which the latter process gives rise to periodic behavior and take into account the role of the rise in InsP3 caused by external stimulation. The analysis further shows how signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations might be effectively encoded in terms of their frequency through the phosphorylation of a cellular substrate by a protein kinase activated by cytosolic Ca2+.},

abstract = {Endothelial cells release nitric oxide (NO) more potently in response to increased shear stress than to agonists which elevate intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). To determine mechanistic differences in the regulation of endothelial constitutive NO synthase (ecNOS), we measured NO production by bovine aortic endothelial cells exposed to shear stress in a laminar flow chamber or treated with Ca2+ ionophores in static culture. The kinetics of cumulative NO production varied strikingly: shear stress (25 dyne/cm2) stimulated a biphasic increase over control that was 13-fold at 60 minutes, whereas raising [Ca2+]i caused a monophasic 6-fold increase. We hypothesized that activation of a protein kinase cascade mediates the early phase of flow-dependent NO production. Immunoprecipitation of ecNOS showed a 210\% increase in phosphorylation 1 minute after flow initiation, whereas there was no significant increase after Ca2+ ionophore treatment. Although ecNOS was not tyrosine-phosphorylated, the early phase of flow-dependent NO production was blocked by genistein, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases. To determine the Ca2+ requirement for flow-dependent NO production, we measured [Ca2+]i with a novel flow-step protocol. [Ca2+]i increased with the onset of shear stress, but not after a step increase. However, the step increase in shear stress was associated with a potent biphasic increase in NO production rate and ecNOS phosphorylation. These studies demonstrate that shear stress can increase NO production in the absence of increased [Ca2+]i, and they suggest that phosphorylation of ecNOS may importantly modulate its activity during the imposition of increased shear stress.},

The different elements of the arginine biosynthetic system of Escherichia coli, including the connection with pyrimidine biosynthesis, and the principal regulatory mechanisms operating at genetic and enzymatic levels were integrated in a mathematical model using a molecular kinetic approach combined with a modular description of the system. The model was then used to simulate a set of perturbed conditions as follows: genetic derepression, feedback resistance of the first enzymatic step, and low constitutive synthesis of the intermediate carbamyl phosphate. In all cases, an excellent quantitative agreement between simulations and experimental results was found. The model was used to gain further insight into the function of the system, including the synergy between the different regulations. The outcome of combinations of perturbations on cellular arginine concentration was predicted accurately, establishing the model as a powerful tool for the design of arginine-overproducing strains.},

In this study, we aimed to determine whether impairment of dCA is associated with atrophy in specific regions or globally, thereby affecting daily functions in stroke patients.We performed a retrospective analysis of 33 subjects with chronic infarctions in the middle cerebral artery territory, and 109 age-matched non-stroke subjects. dCA was assessed via the phase relationship between arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity. Brain tissue volumes were quantified from MRI. Functional status was assessed by gait speed, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), modified Rankin Scale, and NIH Stroke Score.Compared to the non-stroke group, stroke subjects showed degraded dCA bilaterally, and showed gray matter atrophy in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes ipsilateral to infarct. In stroke subjects, better dCA was associated with less temporal lobe gray matter atrophy on the infracted side ([Formula: see text] = 0.029), faster gait speed ([Formula: see text] = 0.018) and lower IADL score ([Formula: see text]0.002). Our results indicate that better dynamic cerebral perfusion regulation is associated with less atrophy and better long-term functional status in older adults with chronic ischemic infarctions.},

There clearly is still an enormous amount of experimental and theoretical work to be done to unravel the precise mechanism of neurovascular coupling, but over the last decade significant advances have been made. The most recent studies confirm the original finding that the activation of Ca(2+) elevations in astrocyte endfeet is an essential step but also reveal new levels of complexity in the astrocyte control of neurovascular coupling. The recent evidence for a link between Ca(2+) signalling in astrocytes and local metabolic states of the brain tissue has broad implications for the interpretation of data from functional brain imaging studies. Unraveling the full molecular mechanism of the astrocyte control of cerebral blood flow represents a formidable challenge in neurobiological research in the years to come that might also create opportunities for the development of new therapeutic strategies for cerebrovascular diseases such as ischemic stroke, hypertension and migraine as well as neurodegenerative diseases as Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Diffusion in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain is constrained by the volume fraction and the tortuosity and a modified diffusion equation represents the transport behavior of many molecules in the brain. Deviations from the equation reveal loss of molecules across the blood-brain barrier, through cellular uptake, binding, or other mechanisms. Early diffusion measurements used radiolabeled sucrose and other tracers. Presently, the real-time iontophoresis (RTI) method is employed for small ions and the integrative optical imaging (IOI) method for fluorescent macromolecules, including dextrans or proteins. Theoretical models and simulations of the ECS have explored the influence of ECS geometry, effects of dead-space microdomains, extracellular matrix, and interaction of macromolecules with ECS channels. Extensive experimental studies with the RTI method employing the cation tetramethylammonium (TMA) in normal brain tissue show that the volume fraction of the ECS typically is approximately 20\% and the tortuosity is approximately 1.6 (i.e., free diffusion coefficient of TMA is reduced by 2.6), although there are regional variations. These parameters change during development and aging. Diffusion properties have been characterized in several interventions, including brain stimulation, osmotic challenge, and knockout of extracellular matrix components. Measurements have also been made during ischemia, in models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and in human gliomas. Overall, these studies improve our conception of ECS structure and the roles of glia and extracellular matrix in modulating the ECS microenvironment. Knowledge of ECS diffusion properties is valuable in contexts ranging from understanding extrasynaptic volume transmission to the development of paradigms for drug delivery to the brain.},

@article{Kapela2008,
abstract = {A mathematical model of calcium dynamics in vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) was developed based on data mostly from rat mesenteric arterioles. The model focuses on (a) the plasma membrane electrophysiology; (b) Ca2+ uptake and release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR); (c) cytosolic balance of Ca2+, Na+, K+, and Cl ions; and (d) IP3 and cGMP formation in response to norepinephrine(NE) and nitric oxide (NO) stimulation. Stimulation with NE induced membrane depolarization and an intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) transient followed by a plateau. The plateau concentrations were mostly determined by the activation of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. NE causes a greater increase in [Ca2+]i than stimulation with KCl to equivalent depolarization. Model simulations suggest that the effect of[Na+]i accumulation on the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) can potentially account for this difference.Elevation of [Ca2+]i within a concentration window (150-300 nM) by NE or KCl initiated [Ca2+]i oscillations with a concentration-dependent period. The oscillations were generated by the nonlinear dynamics of Ca2+ release and refilling in the SR. NO repolarized the NE-stimulated SMC and restored low [Ca2+]i mainly through its effect on Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Under certain conditions, Na+-K+-ATPase inhibition can result in the elevation of [Na+]i and the reversal of NCX, increasing resting cytosolic and SR Ca2+ content, as well as reactivity to NE. Blockade of the NCX's reverse mode could eliminate these effects. We conclude that the integration of the selected cellular components yields a mathematical model that reproduces, satisfactorily, some of the established features of SMC physiology. Simulations suggest a potential role of intracellular Na+ in modulating Ca2+ dynamics and provide insights into the mechanisms of SMC constriction, relaxation, and the phenomenon of vasomotion. The model will provide the basis for the development of multi-cellular mathematical models that will investigate microcirculatory function in health and disease.},

@article{Hamel2006,
abstract = {Brain perfusion is tightly coupled to neuronal activity, is commonly used to monitor normal or pathological brain function, and is a direct reflection of the interactions that occur between neuronal signals and blood vessels. Cerebral blood vessels at the surface and within the brain are surrounded by nerve fibers that originate, respectively, from peripheral nerve ganglia and intrinsic brain neurons. Although of different origin and targeting distinct vascular beds, these "perivascular nerves" fulfill similar roles related to cerebrovascular functions, a major one being to regulate their tone and, therein, brain perfusion. This utmost function, which underlies the signals used in functional neuroimaging techniques and which can be jeopardized in pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and migraine headache, is thus regulated at several levels. Recently, new insights into our understanding of how neural input regulate cerebrovascular tone resulted in the rediscovery of the functional "neurovascular unit." These remarkable advances suggest that neuron-driven changes in vascular tone result from interactions that involve all components of the neurovascular unit, transducing neuronal signals into vasomotor responses not only through direct interaction between neurons and vessels but also indirectly via the perivascular astrocytes. Neurovascular coupling is thus determined by chemical signals released from activated perivascular nerves and astrocytes that alter vascular tone to locally adjust perfusion to the spatial and temporal changes in brain activity.},

abstract = {Prior 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) experiments, which simultaneously measured in vivo rates of total glutamate-glutamine cycling (V(cyc(tot))) and neuronal glucose oxidation (CMR(glc(ox), N)), revealed a linear relationship between these fluxes above isoelectricity, with a slope of approximately 1. In vitro glial culture studies examining glutamate uptake indicated that glutamate, which is cotransported with Na+, stimulated glial uptake of glucose and release of lactate. These in vivo and in vitro results were consolidated into a model: recycling of one molecule of neurotransmitter between glia and neurons was associated with oxidation of one glucose molecule in neurons; however, the glucose was taken up only by glia and all the lactate (pyruvate) generated by glial glycolysis was transferred to neurons for oxidation. The model was consistent with the 1:1 relationship between DeltaCMR(glc(ox), N) and DeltaV(cyc(tot)) measured by 13C MRS. However, the model could not specify the energetics of glia and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) neurons because quantitative values for these pathways were not available. Here, we review recent 13C and 14C tracer studies that enable us to include these fluxes in a more comprehensive model. The revised model shows that glia produce at least 8\% of total oxidative ATP and GABAergic neurons generate approximately 18\% of total oxidative ATP in neurons. Neurons produce at least 88\% of total oxidative ATP, and take up approximately 26\% of the total glucose oxidized. Glial lactate (pyruvate) still makes the major contribution to neuronal oxidation, but approximately 30\% less than predicted by the prior model. The relationship observed between DeltaCMR(glc(ox), N) and DeltaV(cyc(tot)) is determined by glial glycolytic ATP as before. Quantitative aspects of the model, which can be tested by experimentation, are discussed.},

Dysfunction of the BBB occurs in a number of CNS diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). A prevailing hypothesis in the AD field is the amyloid cascade hypothesis that states that amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) deposition in the CNS initiates a cascade of molecular events that cause neurodegeneration, leading to AD onset and progression. In this review, the participation of the BBB in the amyloid cascade and in other mechanisms of AD neurodegeneration will be discussed. We will specifically focus on three aspects of BBB dysfunction: disruption, perturbation of transporters, and secretion of neurotoxic substances by the BBB. We will also discuss the interaction of the BBB with components of the neurovascular unit in relation to AD and the potential contribution of AD risk factors to aspects of BBB dysfunction. From the results discussed herein, we conclude that BBB dysfunction contributes to AD through a number of mechanisms that could be initiated in the presence or absence of A$\beta$ pathology.},

abstract = {Stroke and circulatory arrest cause interferences in blood flow to the brain that result in considerable tissue damage. The primary method to reduce or prevent neurologic damage to patients suffering from brain ischemia is prompt restoration of blood flow to the ischemic tissue. However, paradoxically, restoration of blood flow causes additional damage and exacerbates neurocognitive deficits among patients who suffer a brain ischemic event. Mitochondria play a critical role in reperfusion injury by producing excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) thereby damaging cellular components, and initiating cell death. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the mechanisms of mitochondrial ROS generation during reperfusion, and specifically, the role the mitochondrial membrane potential plays in the pathology of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. Additionally, we propose a temporal model of ROS generation in which posttranslational modifications of key oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) proteins caused by ischemia induce a hyperactive state upon reintroduction of oxygen. Hyperactive OxPhos generates high mitochondrial membrane potentials, a condition known to generate excessive ROS. Such a state would lead to a "burst" of ROS upon reperfusion, thereby causing structural and functional damage to the mitochondria and inducing cell death signaling that eventually culminate in tissue damage. Finally, we propose that strategies aimed at modulating this maladaptive hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential may be a novel therapeutic intervention and present specific studies demonstrating the cytoprotective effect of this treatment modality.},

abstract = {Fluid shear stress activates the endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) by a mechanism which does not require an increase in the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), and is sensitive to several kinase inhibitors. Although phosphorylation of eNOS has been suggested to regulate enzyme activity, the mechanism of eNOS activation is still unclear. Here we demonstrate that fluid shear stress elicits the phosphorylation of eNOS on tyrosine and serine residues. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), using wortmannin or a dominant negative mutant of its downstream target, Akt (protein kinase B), prevented the maintained serine phosphorylation and activation of eNOS. Enhancing eNOS phosphorylation by inhibiting serine/threonine phosphatases, increased eNOS activity by approximately twofold, as assessed by the accumulation of intracellular cyclic GMP, without increasing the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+. These data suggest that shear stress activates a pathway involving PI3K and the serine/threonine kinase Akt, which phosphorylates eNOS. This phosphorylation directly increases eNOS activity at resting [Ca2+]i, thus rendering the shear stress-induced activation of eNOS apparently Ca2+-independent.},

abstract = {Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is dually acylated by N-myristoylation and cysteine palmitoylation and resides in Golgi and caveolae membranes. N-Myristoylation is necessary for its membrane association and targeting into the Golgi complex of transfected cells whereas palmitoylation influences the targeting of eNOS into caveolae. However, the in vivo significance of palmitoylation, membrane association, and the corresponding caveolar localization of eNOS have not been shown. To further examine the nature of membrane association of palmitoylation-deficient forms of eNOS and to address the functional role(s) of palmitoylation in activation of eNOS in vivo, HEk 293 cells stably transfected with wild-type (WT) or palmitoylation-deficient mutants of eNOS were generated. Membrane association of the mutants was biochemically similar to that of the WT protein in terms of their resistance to high salt, high pH, and distribution between Triton X-114 detergent and aqueous phases, suggesting that other hydrophobic factor (s) in eNOS most likely contribute to its membrane association. Most importantly, palmitoylation-deficient mutants of eNOS released less NO from the cells than did WT enzyme, suggesting that palmitoylation plays an important role in determining the optimal release of NO from intact cells. The diminished release of NO from the palmitoylation-deficient mutants was not attributable to alterations in its catalytic properties as the purified mutant and WT enzymes were kinetically identical. Since palmitoylation is necessary for localization of eNOS in caveolae, our data suggest that such localization could regulate the frequency and magnitude of NO release in response to stimuli in vivo.},

abstract = {Astrocytes were the original neuroglia of Ram\'{o}n y Cajal but after 100 years there is no satisfactory definition of what should comprise this class of cells. This essay takes a historical and philosophical approach to the question of astrocytic identity. The classic approach of identification by morphology and location are too limited to determine new members of the astrocyte population. I also critically evaluate the use of protein markers measured by immunoreactivity, as well as the newer technique of marking living cells by using promoters for these same proteins to drive reporter genes. These two latter approaches have yielded an expanded population of astrocytes with diverse functions, but also mark cells that traditionally would not be defined as astrocytes. Thus we need a combination of measures to define an astrocyte but it is not clear what this combination should be. The molecular approach, especially promoter driven fluorescent reporter genes, does have the advantage of pre marking living astrocytes for electrophysiological or imaging recordings. However, lack of sufficient understanding of the behavior of the inserted constructs has led to unclear results. This approach will no doubt be perfected with time but at present an acceptable, practical definition of what constitutes the class of astrocytes remains elusive.},

While much is known about molecular mechanisms underlying cerebral A$\beta$ accumulation in familial AD, less is known about the cause(s) of brain amyloidosis in sporadic disease. Animal and postmortem studies suggest that A$\beta$ secretion can be up-regulated in response to hypoxia. We employed a new technology (Single Molecule Arrays, SiMoA) capable of ultrasensitive protein measurements and developed a novel assay to look for changes in serum A$\beta$42 concentration in 25 resuscitated patients with severe hypoxia due to cardiac arrest. After a lag period of 10 or more hours, very clear serum A$\beta$42 elevations were observed in all patients. Elevations ranged from approximately 80\% to over 70-fold, with most elevations in the range of 3-10-fold (average approximately 7-fold). The magnitude of the increase correlated with clinical outcome. These data provide the first direct evidence in living humans that ischemia acutely increases A$\beta$ levels in blood. The results point to the possibility that hypoxia may play a role in the amyloidogenic process of AD.},

If all the positive entries are log-convex functions, the paper shows that the associated Perron root is log-convex on the parameter set and the l1-norm of the solution is log-convex on the feasibility set. These results imply that the feasibility set is a convex set regardless whether the l1-norm of the solution is bounded by some positive real number or not.

abstract = {Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a slow-moving ionic and metabolic disturbance that propagates in cortical brain tissue. In addition to massive cellular depolarizations, CSD also involves significant changes in perfusion and metabolism-aspects of CSD that had not been modeled and are important to traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and migraine. In this study, we develop a mathematical model for CSD where we focus on modeling the features essential to understanding the implications of neurovascular coupling during CSD. In our model, the sodium-potassium-ATPase, mainly responsible for ionic homeostasis and active during CSD, operates at a rate that is dependent on the supply of oxygen. The supply of oxygen is determined by modeling blood flow through a lumped vascular tree with an effective local vessel radius that is controlled by the extracellular potassium concentration. We show that during CSD, the metabolic demands of the cortex exceed the physiological limits placed on oxygen delivery, regardless of vascular constriction or dilation. However, vasoconstriction and vasodilation play important roles in the propagation of CSD and its recovery. Our model replicates the qualitative and quantitative behavior of CSD--vasoconstriction, oxygen depletion, extracellular potassium elevation, prolonged depolarization--found in experimental studies. We predict faster, longer duration CSD in vivo than in vitro due to the contribution of the vasculature. Our results also help explain some of the variability of CSD between species and even within the same animal. These results have clinical and translational implications, as they allow for more precise in vitro, in vivo, and in silico exploration of a phenomenon broadly relevant to neurological disease.},

Cardiol. 92:59-61) has been proposed to be a regulator of calcium homeostasis and signal transduction networks of the cell. However, little is known about its precise mechanisms of action. Knock-out of (mainly neuronal) isoform 2 of the enzyme resulted in hearing loss and balance deficits due to severe inner ear defects, affecting formation and maintenance of otoconia (Kozel, P.J., R.A. Friedman, L.C. Erway, E.N. Yamoah, L.H. Liu, T. Riddle, J.J. Duffy, T. Doetschman, M.L. Miller, E.L. Cardell, and G.E. Shull. 1998. J. Biol. Chem. 273:18693-18696). Here we demonstrate that PMCA 4b is a negative regulator of nitric oxide synthase I (NOS-I, nNOS) in HEK293 embryonic kidney and neuro-2a neuroblastoma cell models. Binding of PMCA 4b to NOS-I was mediated by interaction of the COOH-terminal amino acids of PMCA 4b and the PDZ domain of NOS-I (PDZ: PSD 95/Dlg/ZO-1 protein domain). Increasing expression of wild-type PMCA 4b (but not PMCA mutants unable to bind PDZ domains or devoid of Ca2+-transporting activity) dramatically downregulated NO synthesis from wild-type NOS-I. A NOS-I mutant lacking the PDZ domain was not regulated by PMCA, demonstrating the specific nature of the PMCA-NOS-I interaction. Elucidation of PMCA as an interaction partner and major regulator of NOS-I provides evidence for a new dimension of integration between calcium and NO signaling pathways.},

This enzyme and splice variants thereof have since been found in many other cells and tissues. NOS II (NOS2, iNOS) was first identified in murine macrophages, but can also be induced in many other cell types. NOS III (NOS3, ecNOS) is expressed mainly in endothelial cells. Whereas NOS II is a transcriptionally regulated enzyme, NOS I and NOS III are considered constitutively expressed proteins. However, evidence generated in recent years indicates that these two isoforms are also subject to expressional regulation. In view of the important biological functions of these isoforms, changes in their expression may have physiological and pathophysiological consequences. This review recapitulates compounds and conditions that modulate the expression of NOS I and NOS III, summarizes transcriptional and posttranscriptional effects that underlie these changes, and-where known-describes the molecular mechanisms leading to changes in transcription, RNA stability, or translation of these enzymes.},

abstract = {Vascular endothelium expressing endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) produces nitric oxide (NO), which has a number of important physiological functions in the microvasculature. The rate of NO production by the endothelium is a critical determinant of NO distribution in the vascular wall. We have analyzed the biochemical pathways of NO synthesis and formulated a model to estimate NO production by the microvascular endothelium under physiological conditions. The model quantifies the NO produced by eNOS based on the kinetics of NO synthesis and the availability of eNOS and its intracellular substrates. The predicted NO production from microvessels was in the range of 0.005-0.1 microM/s. This range of predicted values is in agreement with some experimental values but is much lower than other rates previously measured or estimated from experimental data with the help of mathematical modeling. Paradoxical discrepancies between the model predictions and previously reported results based on experimental measurements of NO concentration in the vicinity of the arteriolar wall suggest that NO can also be released through eNOS-independent mechanisms, such as catalysis by neuronal NOS (nNOS). We also used our model to test the sensitivity of NO production to substrate availability, eNOS concentration, and potential rate-limiting factors. The results indicated that the predicted low level of NO production can be attributed primarily to a low expression of eNOS in the microvascular endothelial cells.},

It is believed that the environmental risk factors play an important role in the onset and development of AD. Patients suffering from cerebral ischemia and stroke in which hypoxic conditions occur are much more susceptible to AD. Increasing evidence suggests that hypoxia facilitates the pathogenesis of AD through accelerating the accumulation of Abeta, increasing the hyperphosphorylation of tau, impairing the normal functions of blood-brain barrier, and promoting the degeneration of neurons. Further investigations into the relationship between hypoxia and AD may open the avenue for effective preservation and pharmacological treatments of this neurodegenerative disease.},

Whisker deflection (60 s) increased rCBF by 18 +/- 3\%. NO synthase (NOS) inhibition by N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA; topically) reduced the rCBF response to 9 +/- 4\% and resting rCBF to 80 +/- 8\%. NO donors [S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP; 50 microM), 3-morpholinosydnonimine (10 microM)] or 8-bromoguanosine 3', 5'-cyclic-monophosphate (8-BrcGMP; 100 microM)] restored resting rCBF and L-NNA-induced attenuation of the whisker response in the presence of L-NNA, whereas the NO-independent vasodilator papaverine (1 mM) had no effect on the whisker response. Basal cGMP levels were decreased to 35\% by L-NNA and restored to 65\% of control by subsequent SNAP superfusion. Inhibition of neuronal NOS by 7-nitroindazole (7-NI; 40 mg/kg ip) or soluble guanylyl cyclase by 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ; 100 microM) significantly reduced resting rCBF to 86 +/- 8 and 92 +/- 10\% and whisker rCBF response to 7 +/- 4 and 12 +/- 3\%, respectively. ODQ reduced tissue cGMP to 54\%. 8-BrcGMP restored the whisker response in the presence of 7-NI or ODQ. We conclude that NO, produced by neuronal NOS, is a modulator in the coupling of neuronal activation and rCBF in rat somatosensory cortex and that this effect is mainly mediated by cGMP. L-NNA-induced vasomotion was significantly reduced during increased neuronal activity and after restoration of basal NO levels, but not after restoration of cGMP.},

abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays critical roles in the maintenance of central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis. Dysfunction of the BBB occurs in a number of CNS diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). A prevailing hypothesis in the AD field is the amyloid cascade hypothesis that states that amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) deposition in the CNS initiates a cascade of molecular events that cause neurodegeneration, leading to AD onset and progression. In this review, the participation of the BBB in the amyloid cascade and in other mechanisms of AD neurodegeneration will be discussed. We will specifically focus on three aspects of BBB dysfunction: disruption, perturbation of transporters, and secretion of neurotoxic substances by the BBB. We will also discuss the interaction of the BBB with components of the neurovascular unit in relation to AD and the potential contribution of AD risk factors to aspects of BBB dysfunction. From the results discussed herein, we conclude that BBB dysfunction contributes to AD through a number of mechanisms that could be initiated in the presence or absence of A$\beta$ pathology.},

It is designed to introduce cell biology and neuroscience students to computational modeling, and applied mathematics students, theoretical biologists, and engineers to many of the problems in dynamical cell biology. This volume was conceived of and begun by Professor Joel Keizer based on his many years of teaching and research together with his colleagues. The project was expanded and finished by his students and friends after his untimely death in 1999. Carefully selected examples are used to motivate the concepts and techniques of computational cell biology, through a progression of increasingly more complex and demanding cases. Illustrative exercises are included with every chapter, and mathematical and computational appendices are provided for reference. This textbook will be useful for advanced undergraduate and graduate theoretical biologists, and for mathematics students and life scientists who wish to learn about modeling in cell biology.

abstract = {Neurovascular coupling in response to stimulation of the rat barrel cortex was investigated using concurrent multichannel electrophysiology and laser Doppler flowmetry. The data were used to build a linear dynamic model relating neural activity to blood flow. Local field potential time series were subject to current source density analysis, and the time series of a layer IV sink of the barrel cortex was used as the input to the model. The model output was the time series of the changes in regional cerebral blood flow (CBF). We show that this model can provide excellent fit of the CBF responses for stimulus durations of up to 16 s. The structure of the model consisted of two coupled components representing vascular dilation and constriction. The complex temporal characteristics of the CBF time series were reproduced by the relatively simple balance of these two components. We show that the impulse response obtained under the 16-s duration stimulation condition generalised to provide a good prediction to the data from the shorter duration stimulation conditions. Furthermore, by optimising three out of the total of nine model parameters, the variability in the data can be well accounted for over a wide range of stimulus conditions. By establishing linearity, classic system analysis methods can be used to generate and explore a range of equivalent model structures (e.g., feed-forward or feedback) to guide the experimental investigation of the control of vascular dilation and constriction following stimulation.},

abstract = {Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a slow-moving ionic and metabolic disturbance that propagates in cortical brain tissue. In addition to massive cellular depolarizations, CSD also involves significant changes in perfusion and metabolism-aspects of CSD that had not been modeled and are important to traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and migraine. In this study, we develop a mathematical model for CSD where we focus on modeling the features essential to understanding the implications of neurovascular coupling during CSD. In our model, the sodium-potassium-ATPase, mainly responsible for ionic homeostasis and active during CSD, operates at a rate that is dependent on the supply of oxygen. The supply of oxygen is determined by modeling blood flow through a lumped vascular tree with an effective local vessel radius that is controlled by the extracellular potassium concentration. We show that during CSD, the metabolic demands of the cortex exceed the physiological limits placed on oxygen delivery, regardless of vascular constriction or dilation. However, vasoconstriction and vasodilation play important roles in the propagation of CSD and its recovery. Our model replicates the qualitative and quantitative behavior of CSD--vasoconstriction, oxygen depletion, extracellular potassium elevation, prolonged depolarization--found in experimental studies. We predict faster, longer duration CSD in vivo than in vitro due to the contribution of the vasculature. Our results also help explain some of the variability of CSD between species and even within the same animal. These results have clinical and translational implications, as they allow for more precise in vitro, in vivo, and in silico exploration of a phenomenon broadly relevant to neurological disease.},

L-NNA-induced vasomotion was significantly reduced during increased neuronal activity and after restoration of basal NO levels, but not after restoration of cGMP.},

Recent advances in high-resolution imaging enable highly detailed three-dimensional geometrical representation of the whole-tumor microvascular architecture. This enormous increase in complexity of image-based data necessitates the application of informatics methods for the analysis, mining and reconstruction of these spatial graph data structures. We present a novel methodology that combines ex-vivo high-resolution micro-computed tomography imaging data with a bioimage informatics algorithm to track and reconstruct the whole-tumor vasculature of a human breast cancer model. The reconstructed tumor vascular network is used as an input of a computational model that estimates blood flow in each segment of the tumor microvascular network. This formulation involves a well-established biophysical model and an optimization algorithm that ensures mass balance and detailed monitoring of all the vessels that feed and drain blood from the tumor microvascular network. Perfusion maps for the whole-tumor microvascular network are computed. Morphological and hemodynamic indices from different regions are compared to infer their role in overall tumor perfusion.},

abstract = {Large-conductance Ca-activated potassium channels (BK channels) are uniquely sensitive to both membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+. Recent work has demonstrated that in the gating of these channels there are voltage-sensitive steps that are separate from Ca2+ binding steps. Based on this result and the macroscopic steady state and kinetic properties of the cloned BK channel mslo, we have recently proposed a general kinetic scheme to describe the interaction between voltage and Ca2+ in the gating of the mslo channel (Cui, J., D.H. Cox, and R.W. Aldrich. 1997. J. Gen. Physiol. In press.). This scheme supposes that the channel exists in two main conformations, closed and open. The conformational change between closed and open is voltage dependent. Ca2+ binds to both the closed and open conformations, but on average binds more tightly to the open conformation and thereby promotes channel opening. Here we describe the basic properties of models of this form and test their ability to mimic mslo macroscopic steady state and kinetic behavior. The simplest form of this scheme corresponds to a voltage-dependent version of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model of allosteric proteins. The success of voltage-dependent MWC models in describing many aspects of mslo gating suggests that these channels may share a common molecular mechanism with other allosteric proteins whose behaviors have been modeled using the MWC formalism. We also demonstrate how this scheme can arise as a simplification of a more complex scheme that is based on the premise that the channel is a homotetramer with a single Ca2+ binding site and a single voltage sensor in each subunit. Aspects of the mslo data not well fitted by the simplified scheme will likely be better accounted for by this more general scheme. The kinetic schemes discussed in this paper may be useful in interpreting the effects of BK channel modifications or mutations.},

abstract = {We developed a mathematical model to investigate the production and transport of nitric oxide (NO) generated by a monolayer of cultured endothelial cells exposed to flow in a parallel plate flow chamber. The objectives were to provide a theoretical framework for interpreting experimental observations and to suggest a quantitative relationship between shear stress and NO production rate. NO production was described as a combination of a basal production rate term and a shear-dependent term. Our results show that the shear stress-dependence of the production of NO by the endothelium influences the nature of mass transport within the boundary layer. We found that the steady state NO concentration near the endothelial surface exhibits a biphasic dependence on shear stress, in which at low flow, NO concentration decreases owing to the enhanced removal by convective transport while only at higher shear stresses does the increased production cause an increase in NO concentration. The unsteady response to step changes in flow exhibits transient fluctuations in NO that can be explained by time-dependent changes in the diffusive and convective mass transport as the concentration profile evolves. Our results indicate that this model can be used to determine the relationship between shear stress and NO production rate from measurements of NO concentration.},

abstract = {Control of cerebral vasculature differs from that of systemic vessels outside the blood-brain barrier. The hypothesis that the endothelium modulates vasomotion via direct myoendothelial coupling was investigated in a small vessel of the cerebral circulation. In the primary branch of the rat basilar artery, membrane potential, diameter, and calcium dynamics associated with vasomotion were examined using selective inhibitors of endothelial function in intact and endothelium-denuded arteries. Vessel anatomy, protein, and mRNA expression were studied using conventional electron microscopy high-resolution ultrastructural and confocal immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR. Membrane potential oscillations were present in both endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and these preceded rhythmical contractions during which adjacent SMC intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) waves were synchronized. Endothelium removal abolished vasomotion and desynchronized adjacent smooth muscle cell [Ca(2+)](i) waves. N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (10 microM) did not mimic this effect, and dibutyryl cGMP (300 muM) failed to resynchronize [Ca(2+)](i) waves in endothelium-denuded arteries. Combined charybdotoxin and apamin abolished vasomotion and depolarized and constricted vessels, even in absence of endothelium. Separately, (37,43)Gap27 and (40)Gap27 abolished vasomotion. Extensive myoendothelial gap junctions (3 per endothelial cell) composed of connexins 37 and 40 connected the endothelial cell and SMC layers. Synchronized vasomotion in rat basilar artery is endothelium dependent, with [Ca(2+)](i) waves generated within SMCs being coordinated by electrical coupling via myoendothelial gap junctions.},

abstract = {Smooth muscle and endothelial cells in the arterial wall are exposed
to mechanical stress. Indeed blood flow induces intraluminal pressure
variations and shear stress. An increase in pressure may induce a
vessel contraction, a phenomenon known as the myogenic response.
Many muscular vessels present vasomotion, i.e., rhythmic diameter
oscillations caused by synchronous cytosolic calcium oscillations
of the smooth muscle cells. Vasomotion has been shown to be modulated
by pressure changes. To get a better understanding of the effect
of stress and in particular pressure on vasomotion, we propose a
model of a blood vessel describing the calcium dynamics in a coupled
population of smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells and the consequent
vessel diameter variations. We show that a rise in pressure increases
the calcium concentration. This may either induce or abolish vasomotion,
or increase its frequency depending on the initial conditions. In
our model the myogenic response is less pronounced for large arteries
than for small arteries and occurs at higher values of pressure if
the wall thickness is increased. Our results are in agreement with
experimental observations concerning a broad range of vessels.},

abstract = {Neuronal activity is thought to communicate to arterioles in the brain through astrocytic calcium (Ca(2+)) signaling to cause local vasodilation. Paradoxically, this communication may cause vasoconstriction in some cases. Here, we show that, regardless of the mechanism by which astrocytic endfoot Ca(2+) was elevated, modest increases in Ca(2+) induced dilation, whereas larger increases switched dilation to constriction. Large-conductance, Ca(2+)-sensitive potassium channels in astrocytic endfeet mediated a majority of the dilation and the entire vasoconstriction, implicating local extracellular K(+) as a vasoactive signal for both dilation and constriction. These results provide evidence for a unifying mechanism that explains the nature and apparent duality of the vascular response, showing that the degree and polarity of neurovascular coupling depends on astrocytic endfoot Ca(2+) and perivascular K(+).},

abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a highly specialized brain endothelial structure of the fully differentiated neurovascular system. In concert with pericytes, astrocytes, and microglia, the BBB separates components of the circulating blood from neurons. Moreover, the BBB maintains the chemical composition of the neuronal "milieu," which is required for proper functioning of neuronal circuits, synaptic transmission, synaptic remodeling, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis in the adult brain. BBB breakdown, due to disruption of the tight junctions, altered transport of molecules between blood and brain and brain and blood, aberrant angiogenesis, vessel regression, brain hypoperfusion, and inflammatory responses, may initiate and/or contribute to a "vicious circle" of the disease process, resulting in progressive synaptic and neuronal dysfunction and loss in disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and others. These findings support developments of new therapeutic approaches for chronic neurodegenerative disorders directed at the BBB and other nonneuronal cells of the neurovascular unit.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is a new intercellular messenger that occurs naturally in the brain without causing overt toxicity. Yet, NO has been implicated as a mediator of cell death in cell death. One explanation is that ischemia causes overproduction of NO, allowing it to react with superoxide to form the potent oxidant peroxynitrite. To address this question, we used immunohistochemistry for citrulline, a marker for NO synthase activity, and 3-nitrotyrosine, a marker for peroxynitrite formation, in mice subjected to reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion. We show that ischemia triggers a marked augmentation in citrulline immunoreactivity but more so in the peri-infarct than the infarcted tissue. This increase is attributable to the activation of a large population (approximately 80\%) of the neuronal isoform of NO synthase (nNOS) that is catalytically inactive during basal conditions, indicating a tight regulation of physiological NO production in the brain. In contrast, 3-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity is restricted to the infarcted tissue and is not present in the peri-infarct tissue. In nNOS(Delta/Delta) mice, known to be protected against ischemia, no 3-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity is detected. Our findings provide a cellular localization for nNOS activation in association with ischemic stroke and establish that NO is not likely a direct neurotoxin, whereas its conversion to peroxynitrite is associated with cell death.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes in midlife or late life increases the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD), and type 1 diabetes has been associated with a higher risk of detrimental cognitive outcomes, although studies from older adults are lacking. We investigated whether individuals with AD were more likely to have a history of diabetes than matched controls from the general aged population.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Information on reimbursed diabetes medication (including both type 1 and 2 diabetes) of all Finnish individuals with reimbursed AD medication in 2005 (n = 28,093) and their AD-free control subjects during 1972-2005 was obtained from a special reimbursement register maintained by the Social Insurance Institute of Finland.

RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes was 11.4\% in the whole study population, 10.7\% (n = 3,012) among control subjects, and 12.0\% (n = 3,372) among AD case subjects. People with AD were more likely to have diabetes than matched control subjects (unadjusted OR 1.14 [95\% CI 1.08-1.20]), even after adjusting for cardiovascular diseases (OR 1.31 [1.22-1.41]). The associations were stronger with diabetes diagnosed at midlife (adjusted OR 1.60 [1.34-1.84] and 1.25 [1.16-1.36] for midlife and late-life diabetes, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with clinically verified AD are more likely to have a history of clinically verified and medically treated diabetes than the general aged population, although the difference is small.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO), the smallest signalling molecule known, is produced by three isoforms of NO synthase (NOS; EC 1.14.13.39). They all utilize l-arginine and molecular oxygen as substrates and require the cofactors reduced nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and (6R-)5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)). All NOS bind calmodulin and contain haem. Neuronal NOS (nNOS, NOS I) is constitutively expressed in central and peripheral neurons and some other cell types. Its functions include synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS), central regulation of blood pressure, smooth muscle relaxation, and vasodilatation via peripheral nitrergic nerves. Nitrergic nerves are of particular importance in the relaxation of corpus cavernosum and penile erection. Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil) require at least a residual nNOS activity for their action. Inducible NOS (NOS II) can be expressed in many cell types in response to lipopolysaccharide, cytokines, or other agents. Inducible NOS generates large amounts of NO that have cytostatic effects on parasitic target cells. Inducible NOS contributes to the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases and septic shock. Endothelial NOS (eNOS, NOS III) is mostly expressed in endothelial cells. It keeps blood vessels dilated, controls blood pressure, and has numerous other vasoprotective and anti-atherosclerotic effects. Many cardiovascular risk factors lead to oxidative stress, eNOS uncoupling, and endothelial dysfunction in the vasculature. Pharmacologically, vascular oxidative stress can be reduced and eNOS functionality restored with renin- and angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors, with angiotensin receptor blockers, and with statins.},

Historically, astrocytes have been studied as a homogeneous group of cells. However, evidence has accumulated that suggests heterogeneity of astrocytes across brain regions as well as within the same brain regions. Astrocytes differ in their morphology, developmental origin, gene expression profile, physiological properties, function, and response to injury and disease. A better understanding of the heterogeneity of astrocytes will greatly aid investigation of the function of astrocytes in normal brain as well as the roles of astrocytes in neurological disorders.},

abstract = {Prior 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) experiments, which simultaneously measured in vivo rates of total glutamate-glutamine cycling (V(cyc(tot))) and neuronal glucose oxidation (CMR(glc(ox), N)), revealed a linear relationship between these fluxes above isoelectricity, with a slope of approximately 1. In vitro glial culture studies examining glutamate uptake indicated that glutamate, which is cotransported with Na+, stimulated glial uptake of glucose and release of lactate. These in vivo and in vitro results were consolidated into a model: recycling of one molecule of neurotransmitter between glia and neurons was associated with oxidation of one glucose molecule in neurons; however, the glucose was taken up only by glia and all the lactate (pyruvate) generated by glial glycolysis was transferred to neurons for oxidation. The model was consistent with the 1:1 relationship between DeltaCMR(glc(ox), N) and DeltaV(cyc(tot)) measured by 13C MRS. However, the model could not specify the energetics of glia and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) neurons because quantitative values for these pathways were not available. Here, we review recent 13C and 14C tracer studies that enable us to include these fluxes in a more comprehensive model. The revised model shows that glia produce at least 8\% of total oxidative ATP and GABAergic neurons generate approximately 18\% of total oxidative ATP in neurons. Neurons produce at least 88\% of total oxidative ATP, and take up approximately 26\% of the total glucose oxidized. Glial lactate (pyruvate) still makes the major contribution to neuronal oxidation, but approximately 30\% less than predicted by the prior model. The relationship observed between DeltaCMR(glc(ox), N) and DeltaV(cyc(tot)) is determined by glial glycolytic ATP as before. Quantitative aspects of the model, which can be tested by experimentation, are discussed.},

Z. 49, 333-369] in which they showed that the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is proportional to the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex predicted by the Michaelis-Menten equation. Because the original text was written in German yet is often quoted by English-speaking authors, we undertook a complete translation of the 1913 publication, which we provide as Supporting Information . Here we introduce the translation, describe the historical context of the work, and show a new analysis of the original data. In doing so, we uncovered several surprises that reveal an interesting glimpse into the early history of enzymology. In particular, our reanalysis of Michaelis and Menten's data using modern computational methods revealed an unanticipated rigor and precision in the original publication and uncovered a sophisticated, comprehensive analysis that has been overlooked in the century since their work was published. Michaelis and Menten not only analyzed initial velocity measurements but also fit their full time course data to the integrated form of the rate equations, including product inhibition, and derived a single global constant to represent all of their data. That constant was not the Michaelis constant, but rather V(max)/K(m), the specificity constant times the enzyme concentration (k(cat)/K(m) × E(0)).},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is a relative newcomer to pharmacology, as the paper which initiated the field was published only 25 years ago. Nevertheless its impact is such that to date more than 31,000 papers have been published with NO in the title and more than 65,000 refer to it in some way. The identification of NO with endothelium-derived relaxing factor and the discovery of its synthesis from L-arginine led to the realisation that the L-arginine: NO pathway is widespread and plays a variety of physiological roles. These include the maintenance of vascular tone, neurotransmitter function in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, and mediation of cellular defence. In addition, NO interacts with mitochondrial systems to regulate cell respiration and to augment the generation of reactive oxygen species, thus triggering mechanisms of cell survival or death. This review will focus on the role of NO in the cardiovascular system where, in addition to maintaining a vasodilator tone, it inhibits platelet aggregation and adhesion and modulates smooth muscle cell proliferation. NO has been implicated in a number of cardiovascular diseases and virtually every risk factor for these appears to be associated with a reduction in endothelial generation of NO. Reduced basal NO synthesis or action leads to vasoconstriction, elevated blood pressure and thrombus formation. By contrast, overproduction of NO leads to vasodilatation, hypotension, vascular leakage, and disruption of cell metabolism. Appropriate pharmacological or molecular biological manipulation of the generation of NO will doubtless prove beneficial in such conditions.},

abstract = {The understanding of the unorthodox actions of neuronal-derived nitric oxide ((•)NO) in the brain has been constrained by uncertainties regarding its quantitative profile of change in time and space. As a diffusible intercellular messenger, conveying information associated with its concentration dynamics, both the synthesis via glutamate stimulus and inactivation pathways determine the profile of (•)NO concentration change. In vivo studies, encompassing the real-time measurement of (•)NO concentration dynamics have allowed us to gain quantitative insights into the mechanisms inherent to (•)NO-mediated signaling pathways. It has been of particular interest to study the diffusion properties and half-life, the interplay between (•)NO and O(2) and the ensuing functional consequences for regulation of O(2) consumption, the role of vasculature in shaping (•)NO signals in vivo, and the mechanisms that are responsible for (•)NO to achieve the coupling between glutamatergic neuronal activation and local microcirculation.},

abstract = {Brain perfusion is tightly coupled to neuronal activity, is commonly used to monitor normal or pathological brain function, and is a direct reflection of the interactions that occur between neuronal signals and blood vessels. Cerebral blood vessels at the surface and within the brain are surrounded by nerve fibers that originate, respectively, from peripheral nerve ganglia and intrinsic brain neurons. Although of different origin and targeting distinct vascular beds, these "perivascular nerves" fulfill similar roles related to cerebrovascular functions, a major one being to regulate their tone and, therein, brain perfusion. This utmost function, which underlies the signals used in functional neuroimaging techniques and which can be jeopardized in pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and migraine headache, is thus regulated at several levels. Recently, new insights into our understanding of how neural input regulate cerebrovascular tone resulted in the rediscovery of the functional "neurovascular unit." These remarkable advances suggest that neuron-driven changes in vascular tone result from interactions that involve all components of the neurovascular unit, transducing neuronal signals into vasomotor responses not only through direct interaction between neurons and vessels but also indirectly via the perivascular astrocytes. Neurovascular coupling is thus determined by chemical signals released from activated perivascular nerves and astrocytes that alter vascular tone to locally adjust perfusion to the spatial and temporal changes in brain activity.},

abstract = {S100B is an EF-hand calcium-binding protein that exerts both intracellular and extracellular effects on a variety of cellular processes. The protein is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system by astrocytes, both physiologically and during the course of neurological disease. In the healthy adult brain and during development, constitutive S100B expression acts as a trophic factor to drive neurite extension and to referee neuroplasticity. Yet, when induced during central nervous system disease, the protein can take on maladaptive roles and thereby exacerbate brain pathology. Based on genetic and pharmacological lines of evidence, we consider such deleterious roles of S100B in two common brain pathologies: ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In rodent models of ischemic brain damage, S100B is induced early on during the subacute phase, where it exacerbates gliosis and delayed infarct expansion and thereby worsens functional recovery. In mouse models of AD, S100B drives brain inflammation and gliosis that accelerate cerebral amyloidosis. Pharmacological inhibition of S100B synthesis mitigates hallmark pathologies of both brain diseases, opening the door for translational approaches to treat these devastating neurological disorders.},

Astrocytes are organized into distinct nonoverlapping domains and extend elaborate and dense fine processes that interact intimately with synapses and cerebrovasculature. The recognition in the mid 1990s that astrocytes undergo elevations in intracellular calcium concentration following activation of G protein-coupled receptors by synaptically released neurotransmitters demonstrated not only that astrocytes display a form of excitability but also that astrocytes may be active participants in brain information processing. The roles that astrocytic calcium elevations play in neurophysiology and especially in modulation of neuronal activity have been intensely researched in recent years. This review will summarize the current understanding of the function of astrocytic calcium signaling in neurophysiological processes and discuss areas where the role of astrocytes remains controversial and will therefore benefit from further study.},

abstract = {We developed a new technique to estimate the aortic pressure (AP) waveform from a single peripheral artery pressure (PAP) waveform. The technique 1) employs a parallel tube model of the arterial tree to establish a transfer function relating PAP to AP with unknown parameters; 2) estimates the parameters from the measured PAP waveform, along with a single non-invasive measurement of the wave transmission delay from the aorta to the peripheral artery measurement site, by exploiting the fact that aortic flow is zero during diastole; and 3) applies the transfer function to the PAP waveform to predict the unmeasured AP waveform. In this way, in contrast to the conventional generalized transfer function paradigm, the transfer function is able to adapt to the inter-subject and temporal variability of the arterial tree. We applied this adaptive transfer function technique to PAP waveforms measured from five dogs instrumented with reference AP catheters during various hemodynamic interventions. Our results showed that the technique was able to reliably estimate the AP waveform with an overall error of 4.2 mmHg. For comparison, the corresponding errors of two previously proposed generalized transfer functions trained on a subset of the same canine data were, on average, 19\% larger.},

abstract = {Induction of tumor angiogenesis is among the hallmarks of cancer and a driver of metastatic cascade initiation. Recent advances in high-resolution imaging enable highly detailed three-dimensional geometrical representation of the whole-tumor microvascular architecture. This enormous increase in complexity of image-based data necessitates the application of informatics methods for the analysis, mining and reconstruction of these spatial graph data structures. We present a novel methodology that combines ex-vivo high-resolution micro-computed tomography imaging data with a bioimage informatics algorithm to track and reconstruct the whole-tumor vasculature of a human breast cancer model. The reconstructed tumor vascular network is used as an input of a computational model that estimates blood flow in each segment of the tumor microvascular network. This formulation involves a well-established biophysical model and an optimization algorithm that ensures mass balance and detailed monitoring of all the vessels that feed and drain blood from the tumor microvascular network. Perfusion maps for the whole-tumor microvascular network are computed. Morphological and hemodynamic indices from different regions are compared to infer their role in overall tumor perfusion.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule that is widely used in the nervous system. With recognition of its roles in synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation, LTP; long-term depression, LTD) and elucidation of calcium-dependent, NMDAR-mediated activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), numerous molecular and pharmacological tools have been used to explore the physiology and pathological consequences for nitrergic signaling. In this review, the authors summarize the current understanding of this subtle signaling pathway, discuss the evidence for nitrergic modulation of ion channels and homeostatic modulation of intrinsic excitability, and speculate about the pathological consequences of spillover between different nitrergic compartments in contributing to aberrant signaling in neurodegenerative disorders. Accumulating evidence points to various ion channels and particularly voltage-gated potassium channels as signaling targets, whereby NO mediates activity-dependent control of intrinsic neuronal excitability; such changes could underlie broader mechanisms of synaptic plasticity across neuronal networks. In addition, the inability to constrain NO diffusion suggests that spillover from endothelium (eNOS) and/or immune compartments (iNOS) into the nervous system provides potential pathological sources of NO and where control failure in these other systems could have broader neurological implications. Abnormal NO signaling could therefore contribute to a variety of neurodegenerative pathologies such as stroke/excitotoxicity, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease.},

In concert with pericytes, astrocytes, and microglia, the BBB separates components of the circulating blood from neurons. Moreover, the BBB maintains the chemical composition of the neuronal "milieu," which is required for proper functioning of neuronal circuits, synaptic transmission, synaptic remodeling, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis in the adult brain. BBB breakdown, due to disruption of the tight junctions, altered transport of molecules between blood and brain and brain and blood, aberrant angiogenesis, vessel regression, brain hypoperfusion, and inflammatory responses, may initiate and/or contribute to a "vicious circle" of the disease process, resulting in progressive synaptic and neuronal dysfunction and loss in disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and others. These findings support developments of new therapeutic approaches for chronic neurodegenerative disorders directed at the BBB and other nonneuronal cells of the neurovascular unit.},

abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is formed by brain endothelial cells lining the cerebral microvasculature, and is an important mechanism for protecting the brain from fluctuations in plasma composition, and from circulating agents such as neurotransmitters and xenobiotics capable of disturbing neural function. The barrier also plays an important role in the homeostatic regulation of the brain microenvironment necessary for the stable and co-ordinated activity of neurones. The BBB phenotype develops under the influence of associated brain cells, especially astrocytic glia, and consists of more complex tight junctions than in other capillary endothelia, and a number of specific transport and enzyme systems which regulate molecular traffic across the endothelial cells. Transporters characteristic of the BBB phenotype include both uptake mechanisms (e.g. GLUT-1 glucose carrier, L1 amino acid transporter) and efflux transporters (e.g. P-glycoprotein). In addition to a role in long-term barrier induction and maintenance, astrocytes and other cells can release chemical factors that modulate endothelial permeability over a time-scale of seconds to minutes. Cell culture models, both primary and cell lines, have been used to investigate aspects of barrier induction and modulation. Conditioned medium taken from growing glial cells can reproduce some of the inductive effects, evidence for involvement of diffusible factors. However, for some features of endothelial differentiation and induction, the extracellular matrix plays an important role. Several candidate molecules have been identified, capable of mimicking aspects of glial-mediated barrier induction of brain endothelium; these include TGFbeta, GDNF, bFGF, IL-6 and steroids. In addition, factors secreted by brain endothelial cells including leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) have been shown to induce astrocytic differentiation. Thus endothelium and astrocytes are involved in two-way induction. Short-term modulation of brain endothelial permeability has been shown for a number of small chemical mediators produced by astrocytes and other nearby cell types. It is clear that endothelial cells are involved in both long- and short-term chemical communication with neighbouring cells, with the perivascular end feet of astrocytes being of particular importance. The role of barrier induction and modulation in normal physiology and in pathology is discussed.},

abstract = {The brain is a heterogeneous organ with regionally varied and constantly changing energetic needs. Blood vessels in the brain are equipped with control mechanisms that match oxygen and glucose delivery through blood flow with the local metabolic demands that are imposed by neural activity. However, the cellular bases of this mechanism have remained elusive. A major advance has been the demonstration that astrocytes, cells with extensive contacts with both synapses and cerebral blood vessels, participate in the increases in flow evoked by synaptic activity. Their organization in nonoverlapping spatial domains indicates that they are uniquely positioned to shape the spatial distribution of the vascular responses that are evoked by neural activity. Astrocytic calcium is an important determinant of microvascular function and may regulate flow independently of synaptic activity. The involvement of astrocytes in neurovascular coupling has broad implications for the interpretation of functional imaging signals and for the understanding of brain diseases that are associated with neurovascular dysfunction.},

abstract = {Endothelial cells release nitric oxide (NO) more potently in response to increased shear stress than to agonists which elevate intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). To determine mechanistic differences in the regulation of endothelial constitutive NO synthase (ecNOS), we measured NO production by bovine aortic endothelial cells exposed to shear stress in a laminar flow chamber or treated with Ca2+ ionophores in static culture. The kinetics of cumulative NO production varied strikingly: shear stress (25 dyne/cm2) stimulated a biphasic increase over control that was 13-fold at 60 minutes, whereas raising [Ca2+]i caused a monophasic 6-fold increase. We hypothesized that activation of a protein kinase cascade mediates the early phase of flow-dependent NO production. Immunoprecipitation of ecNOS showed a 210\% increase in phosphorylation 1 minute after flow initiation, whereas there was no significant increase after Ca2+ ionophore treatment. Although ecNOS was not tyrosine-phosphorylated, the early phase of flow-dependent NO production was blocked by genistein, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases. To determine the Ca2+ requirement for flow-dependent NO production, we measured [Ca2+]i with a novel flow-step protocol. [Ca2+]i increased with the onset of shear stress, but not after a step increase. However, the step increase in shear stress was associated with a potent biphasic increase in NO production rate and ecNOS phosphorylation. These studies demonstrate that shear stress can increase NO production in the absence of increased [Ca2+]i, and they suggest that phosphorylation of ecNOS may importantly modulate its activity during the imposition of increased shear stress.},

abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a highly specialized brain endothelial structure of the fully differentiated neurovascular system. In concert with pericytes, astrocytes, and microglia, the BBB separates components of the circulating blood from neurons. Moreover, the BBB maintains the chemical composition of the neuronal "milieu," which is required for proper functioning of neuronal circuits, synaptic transmission, synaptic remodeling, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis in the adult brain. BBB breakdown, due to disruption of the tight junctions, altered transport of molecules between blood and brain and brain and blood, aberrant angiogenesis, vessel regression, brain hypoperfusion, and inflammatory responses, may initiate and/or contribute to a "vicious circle" of the disease process, resulting in progressive synaptic and neuronal dysfunction and loss in disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and others. These findings support developments of new therapeutic approaches for chronic neurodegenerative disorders directed at the BBB and other nonneuronal cells of the neurovascular unit.},

While much is known about molecular mechanisms underlying cerebral A$\beta$ accumulation in familial AD, less is known about the cause(s) of brain amyloidosis in sporadic disease. Animal and postmortem studies suggest that A$\beta$ secretion can be up-regulated in response to hypoxia. We employed a new technology (Single Molecule Arrays, SiMoA) capable of ultrasensitive protein measurements and developed a novel assay to look for changes in serum A$\beta$42 concentration in 25 resuscitated patients with severe hypoxia due to cardiac arrest. After a lag period of 10 or more hours, very clear serum A$\beta$42 elevations were observed in all patients. Elevations ranged from approximately 80\% to over 70-fold, with most elevations in the range of 3-10-fold (average approximately 7-fold). The magnitude of the increase correlated with clinical outcome. These data provide the first direct evidence in living humans that ischemia acutely increases A$\beta$ levels in blood. The results point to the possibility that hypoxia may play a role in the amyloidogenic process of AD.},

abstract = {Thrombin has been found in neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Also, traumatic brain injury, where neurons are exposed to high thrombin levels, is associated with an increased incidence of AD. Our objective was to determine the effects of thrombin administered in vivo on cognitive function and neuropathology. Rats were trained using a radial eight-arm maze and then thrombin (25 or 100 nM, 0.25 microl/h, 28 days) or vehicle was delivered via intracerebroventricular infusion. Animals that received 100 nM thrombin demonstrated cognitive impairments including deficits in reference memory and an increase in task latency. Also, significant neuropathology was detected in these animals such as enlargement of cerebral ventricles, an increased number of TUNEL-positive cells, astrogliosis, and an increase in the immunoreactivity for phosphorylated neurofilament, and apolipoprotein-E fragments. Thrombin-induced changes in cognitive function and ventricular enlargement were inhibited by hirudin. These findings demonstrate that thrombin is a mediator of neurotoxicity and cognitive deficits and suggest that inhibition of thrombin may be a treatment strategy for AD- or head trauma-associated cognitive deficits.},

These quantities are parameters in a simple lumped parameter model that predicts pressure and flow in the systemic circulation. The model is combined with experimental measurements of blood flow velocity from the middle cerebral artery and arterial finger blood pressure. To estimate the model parameters we use nonlinear optimization combined with sensitivity analysis and subset selection. Sensitivity analysis allows us to rank model parameters from the most to the least sensitive with respect to the output states (cerebral blood flow velocity and arterial blood pressure). Subset selection allows us to identify a set of independent candidate parameters that can be estimated given limited data. Analyses of output from both methods allow us to identify five independent sensitive parameters that can be estimated given the data. Results show that with the advance of age total systemic and cerebral resistances increase, that time for peak systolic ventricular pressure is increases, and that arterial compliance is reduced. Thus, the method discussed in this study provides a new methodology to extract clinical markers that cannot easily be assessed noninvasively.},

abstract = {A mathematical model of calcium dynamics in vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) was developed based on data mostly from rat mesenteric arterioles. The model focuses on (a) the plasma membrane electrophysiology; (b) Ca2+ uptake and release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR); (c) cytosolic balance of Ca2+, Na+, K+, and Cl ions; and (d) IP3 and cGMP formation in response to norepinephrine(NE) and nitric oxide (NO) stimulation. Stimulation with NE induced membrane depolarization and an intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) transient followed by a plateau. The plateau concentrations were mostly determined by the activation of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. NE causes a greater increase in [Ca2+]i than stimulation with KCl to equivalent depolarization. Model simulations suggest that the effect of[Na+]i accumulation on the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) can potentially account for this difference.Elevation of [Ca2+]i within a concentration window (150-300 nM) by NE or KCl initiated [Ca2+]i oscillations with a concentration-dependent period. The oscillations were generated by the nonlinear dynamics of Ca2+ release and refilling in the SR. NO repolarized the NE-stimulated SMC and restored low [Ca2+]i mainly through its effect on Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Under certain conditions, Na+-K+-ATPase inhibition can result in the elevation of [Na+]i and the reversal of NCX, increasing resting cytosolic and SR Ca2+ content, as well as reactivity to NE. Blockade of the NCX's reverse mode could eliminate these effects. We conclude that the integration of the selected cellular components yields a mathematical model that reproduces, satisfactorily, some of the established features of SMC physiology. Simulations suggest a potential role of intracellular Na+ in modulating Ca2+ dynamics and provide insights into the mechanisms of SMC constriction, relaxation, and the phenomenon of vasomotion. The model will provide the basis for the development of multi-cellular mathematical models that will investigate microcirculatory function in health and disease.},

abstract = {An important issue in synaptic physiology is the extent to which postsynaptic receptors are saturated by the neurotransmitter released from a single synaptic vesicle. Although the bulk of evidence supports receptor saturation, recent studies have started to reveal that alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors may not be saturated by a single vesicle of glutamate. Here, we address this question through a study of putative single synapses, made by hippocampal neurons in culture, that are identified by FM1-43 staining. An analysis of the sources of variability in the amplitudes of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents at single synapses reveals that this variability must arise presynaptically, from variations in the quantity of agonist released. Thus, glutamate receptors at hippocampal synapses are not generally saturated by quantal release.},

abstract = {Endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is the predominant enzyme responsible for vascular NO synthesis. A functional eNOS transfers electrons from NADPH to its heme center, where L-arginine is oxidized to L-citrulline and NO. Common conditions predisposing to atherosclerosis, such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus and smoking, are associated with enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduced amounts of bioactive NO in the vessel wall. NADPH oxidases represent major sources of ROS in cardiovascular pathophysiology. NADPH oxidase-derived superoxide avidly interacts with eNOS-derived NO to form peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)), which oxidizes the essential NOS cofactor (6R-)5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)). As a consequence, oxygen reduction uncouples from NO synthesis, thereby rendering NOS to a superoxide-producing pro-atherosclerotic enzyme. Supplementation with BH(4) corrects eNOS dysfunction in several animal models and in patients. Administration of high local doses of the antioxidant L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) improves endothelial function, whereas large-scale clinical trials do not support a strong role for oral vitamin C and/or E in reducing cardiovascular disease. Statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1 receptor blockers have the potential of reducing vascular oxidative stress. Finally, novel approaches are being tested to block pathways leading to oxidative stress (e.g. protein kinase C) or to upregulate antioxidant enzymes.},

abstract = {We previously showed that pancreatic beta-cells express a neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) that controls insulin secretion by exerting two enzymatic activities: nitric oxide (NO) production and cytochrome c reductase activity. We now bring evidence that two inhibitors of nNOS, N-omega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) and 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), increase glucose-induced insulin secretion but affect beta-cell function differently. In the presence of l-NAME, insulin response is monophasic, whereas 7-NI preserves the normal biphasic secretory pattern. In addition, the alterations of beta-cell functional response induced by the inhibitors also differ by their sensitivity to a substitutive treatment with sodium nitroprusside, a chemical NO donor. These differences are probably related to the nature of the two inhibitors. Indeed, using low-temperature SDS-PAGE and real-time analysis of nNOS dimerization by surface plasmon resonance, we could show that 7-NI, which competes with arginine and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), an essential cofactor for nNOS dimer formation, inhibits dimerization of the enzyme, whereas the substrate-based inhibitor l-NAME stabilizes the homodimeric state of nNOS. The latter effect could be reproduced by the two endogenous inhibitors of NOS, N-omega-methyl-l-arginine and asymmetric dimethylarginine, and resulted interestingly in a reduced ability of the protein inhibitor of nNOS (PIN) to dissociate nNOS dimers. We conclude that intracellular factors able to induce abnormalities in the nNOS monomer/dimer equilibrium could lead to pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction.},

We report that transgenic mice overexpressing APP and Abeta have a profound attenuation in the increase in neocortical blood flow elicited by somatosensory activation. The impairment is highly correlated with brain Abeta concentration and is reproduced in normal mice by topical neocortical application of exogenous Abeta1-40 but not Abeta1-42. Overexpression of M146L mutant presenilin-1 in APP mice enhances the production of Abeta1-42 severalfold, but it does not produce a commensurate attenuation of the hyperemic response. APP and Abeta overexpression do not diminish the intensity of neural activation, as reflected by the increase in somatosensory cortex glucose usage. Thus, Abeta-induced alterations in functional hyperemia produce a potentially deleterious mismatch between substrate delivery and energy demands imposed by neural activity.},

abstract = {Cerebral autoregulation (CA) is an most important mechanism responsible for the relatively constant blood flow supply to brain when cerebral perfusion pressure varies. Its assessment in nonacute cases has been relied on the quantification of the relationship between noninvasive beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) and blood flow velocity (BFV). To overcome the nonstationary nature of physiological signals such as BP and BFV, a computational method called multimodal pressure-flow (MMPF) analysis was recently developed to study the nonlinear BP-BFV relationship during the Valsalva maneuver (VM). The present study aimed to determine (i) whether this method can estimate autoregulation from spontaneous BP and BFV fluctuations during baseline rest conditions; (ii) whether there is any difference between the MMPF measures of autoregulation based on intra-arterial BP (ABP) and based on cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP); and (iii) whether the MMPF method provides reproducible and reliable measure for noninvasive assessment of autoregulation. To achieve these aims, we analyzed data from existing databases including: (i) ABP and BFV of 12 healthy control, 10 hypertensive, and 10 stroke subjects during baseline resting conditions and during the Valsalva maneuver, and (ii) ABP, CPP, and BFV of 30 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who were being paralyzed, sedated, and ventilated. We showed that autoregulation in healthy control subjects can be characterized by specific phase shifts between BP and BFV oscillations during the Valsalva maneuver, and the BP-BFV phase shifts were reduced in hypertensive and stroke subjects (P < 0.01), indicating impaired autoregulation. Similar results were found during baseline condition from spontaneous BP and BFV oscillations. The BP-BFV phase shifts obtained during baseline and during VM were highly correlated (R > 0.8, P < 0.0001), showing no statistical difference (paired-t test P > 0.47). In TBI patients there were strong correlations between phases of ABP and CPP oscillations (R = 0.99, P < 0.0001) and, thus, between ABP-BFV and CPP-BFV phase shifts (P < 0.0001, R = 0.76). By repeating the MMPF 4 times on data of TBI subjects, each time on a selected cycle of spontaneous BP and BFV oscillations, we showed that MMPF had better reproducibility than traditional autoregulation index. These results indicate that the MMPF method, based on instantaneous phase relationships between cerebral blood flow velocity and peripheral blood pressure, has better performance than the traditional standard method, and can reliably assess cerebral autoregulation dynamics from ambulatory blood pressure and cerebral blood flow during supine rest conditions.},

We present a novel methodology that combines ex-vivo high-resolution micro-computed tomography imaging data with a bioimage informatics algorithm to track and reconstruct the whole-tumor vasculature of a human breast cancer model. The reconstructed tumor vascular network is used as an input of a computational model that estimates blood flow in each segment of the tumor microvascular network. This formulation involves a well-established biophysical model and an optimization algorithm that ensures mass balance and detailed monitoring of all the vessels that feed and drain blood from the tumor microvascular network. Perfusion maps for the whole-tumor microvascular network are computed. Morphological and hemodynamic indices from different regions are compared to infer their role in overall tumor perfusion.},

abstract = {A numerical model of neurovascular coupling (NVC) is presented based on neuronal activity coupled to vasodilation/contraction models via the astrocytic mediated perivascular K(+) and the smooth muscle cell Ca(2+) pathway. Luminal agonists acting on P2Y receptors on the endothelial cell surface provide a flux of IP3 into the endothelial cytosol. This concentration of IP3 is transported via gap junctions between endothelial and smooth muscle cells providing a source of sacroplasmic derived Ca(2+) in the smooth muscle cell. The model is able to relate a neuronal input signal to the corresponding vessel reaction. Results indicate that blood flow mediated IP3 production via the agonist ATP has a substantial effect on the contraction/dilation dynamics of the SMC. The resulting variation in cytosolic Ca(2+) can enhance and inhibit the flow of blood to the cortical tissue. IP3 coupling between endothelial and smooth muscle cells seems to be important in the dynamics of the smooth muscle cell. The VOCC channels are, due to the hyperpolarisation from K(+) SMC efflux, almost entirely closed and do not seem to play a significant role during neuronal activity. The current model shows that astrocytic Ca(2+) is not necessary for neurovascular coupling to occur in contrast to a number of experiments outlining the importance of astrocytic Ca(2+) in NVC, however this Ca(2+) pathway is not the only one mediating NVC. Importantly agonists in flowing blood have a significant influence on the endothelial and smooth muscle cell dynamics.},

We have developed the first interactional model of bidirectional signaling in the neurovascular unit. The vascular model includes a description of vasomotion, the vascular oscillatory response to transmural pressure, observed in vivo. The communication mechanisms in the model include neural synaptic glutamate and potassium signaling to the astrocytes, potassium signaling from the astrocyte to the microvasculature, and astrocytic mechanosensation of vascular changes. The model response of the astrocyte to arteriolar dilation is validated with recent in vivo and in vitro experimental results. The model reproduces for the first time the in vitro observed phenomenon in which arteriole radius and Ca(2+) oscillations, "vasomotion," are damped due to neural induced astrocytic signaling.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanism of brain glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier is of importance to understanding brain energy metabolism. The specific kinetics of glucose transport have been generally described using standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics. These models predict that the steady-state glucose concentration approaches an upper limit in the human brain when the plasma glucose level is well above the Michaelis-Menten constant for half-maximal transport, Kt. In experiments where steady-state plasma glucose content was varied from 4 to 30 mM, the brain glucose level was a linear function of plasma glucose concentration. At plasma concentrations nearing 30 mM, the brain glucose level approached 9 mM, which was significantly higher than predicted from the previously reported Kt of approximately 4 mM (p < 0.05). The high brain glucose concentration measured in the human brain suggests that ablumenal brain glucose may compete with lumenal glucose for transport. We developed a model based on a reversible Michaelis-Menten kinetic formulation of unidirectional transport rates. Fitting this model to brain glucose level as a function of plasma glucose level gave a substantially lower Kt of 0.6 +/- 2.0 mM, which was consistent with the previously reported millimolar Km of GLUT-1 in erythrocyte model systems. Previously reported and reanalyzed quantification provided consistent kinetic parameters. We conclude that cerebral glucose transport is most consistently described when using reversible Michaelis-Menten kinetics.},

abstract = {In the past two decades, over 1000 clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a benefit in treating stroke, with the exception of thrombolytics. Although many targets have been pursued, including antioxidants, calcium channel blockers, glutamate receptor blockers, and neurotrophic factors, often the focus has been on neuronal mechanisms of injury. Broader attention to loss and dysfunction of non-neuronal cell types is now required to increase the chance of success. Of the several glial cell types, this review will focus on astrocytes. Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the higher mammalian nervous system, and they play key roles in normal CNS physiology and in central nervous system injury and pathology. In the setting of ischemia astrocytes perform multiple functions, some beneficial and some potentially detrimental, making them excellent candidates as therapeutic targets to improve outcome following stroke and in other central nervous system injuries. The older neurocentric view of the central nervous system has changed radically with the growing understanding of the many essential functions of astrocytes. These include K+ buffering, glutamate clearance, brain antioxidant defense, close metabolic coupling with neurons, and modulation of neuronal excitability. In this review, we will focus on those functions of astrocytes that can both protect and endanger neurons, and discuss how manipulating these functions provides a novel and important strategy to enhance neuronal survival and improve outcome following cerebral ischemia.},

@article{Eliasson1999,
abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is a new intercellular messenger that occurs naturally in the brain without causing overt toxicity. Yet, NO has been implicated as a mediator of cell death in cell death. One explanation is that ischemia causes overproduction of NO, allowing it to react with superoxide to form the potent oxidant peroxynitrite. To address this question, we used immunohistochemistry for citrulline, a marker for NO synthase activity, and 3-nitrotyrosine, a marker for peroxynitrite formation, in mice subjected to reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion. We show that ischemia triggers a marked augmentation in citrulline immunoreactivity but more so in the peri-infarct than the infarcted tissue. This increase is attributable to the activation of a large population (approximately 80\%) of the neuronal isoform of NO synthase (nNOS) that is catalytically inactive during basal conditions, indicating a tight regulation of physiological NO production in the brain. In contrast, 3-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity is restricted to the infarcted tissue and is not present in the peri-infarct tissue. In nNOS(Delta/Delta) mice, known to be protected against ischemia, no 3-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity is detected. Our findings provide a cellular localization for nNOS activation in association with ischemic stroke and establish that NO is not likely a direct neurotoxin, whereas its conversion to peroxynitrite is associated with cell death.},

The exact role of pericytes in the neurovascular unit in the adult brain and during brain aging remains, however, elusive. Using adult viable pericyte-deficient mice, we show that pericyte loss leads to brain vascular damage by two parallel pathways: (1) reduction in brain microcirculation causing diminished brain capillary perfusion, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral blood flow responses to brain activation that ultimately mediates chronic perfusion stress and hypoxia, and (2) blood-brain barrier breakdown associated with brain accumulation of serum proteins and several vasculotoxic and/or neurotoxic macromolecules ultimately leading to secondary neuronal degenerative changes. We show that age-dependent vascular damage in pericyte-deficient mice precedes neuronal degenerative changes, learning and memory impairment, and the neuroinflammatory response. Thus, pericytes control key neurovascular functions that are necessary for proper neuronal structure and function, and pericyte loss results in a progressive age-dependent vascular-mediated neurodegeneration.},

After several years of intense research since the pioneer discovery of astrocytic calcium waves and glutamate release onto neurons in vitro, the neuronal-glial studies have answered many questions thanks to technological advances. However, the definitive in vivo role of astrocytes remains to be addressed. In addition, it is becoming clear that diverse populations of astrocytes coexist with different molecular identities and specialized functions adjusted to their microenvironment, but do they all belong to the umbrella family of astrocytes? One population of astrocytes takes on a new function by displaying both support cell and stem cell characteristics in the neurogenic niches. Here, we define characteristics that classify a cell as an astrocyte under physiological conditions. We will also discuss the well-established and emerging functions of astrocytes with an emphasis on their roles on neuronal activity and as neural stem cells in adult neurogenic zones.},

abstract = {Large-conductance Ca-activated potassium channels (BK channels) are uniquely sensitive to both membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+. Recent work has demonstrated that in the gating of these channels there are voltage-sensitive steps that are separate from Ca2+ binding steps. Based on this result and the macroscopic steady state and kinetic properties of the cloned BK channel mslo, we have recently proposed a general kinetic scheme to describe the interaction between voltage and Ca2+ in the gating of the mslo channel (Cui, J., D.H. Cox, and R.W. Aldrich. 1997. J. Gen. Physiol. In press.). This scheme supposes that the channel exists in two main conformations, closed and open. The conformational change between closed and open is voltage dependent. Ca2+ binds to both the closed and open conformations, but on average binds more tightly to the open conformation and thereby promotes channel opening. Here we describe the basic properties of models of this form and test their ability to mimic mslo macroscopic steady state and kinetic behavior. The simplest form of this scheme corresponds to a voltage-dependent version of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model of allosteric proteins. The success of voltage-dependent MWC models in describing many aspects of mslo gating suggests that these channels may share a common molecular mechanism with other allosteric proteins whose behaviors have been modeled using the MWC formalism. We also demonstrate how this scheme can arise as a simplification of a more complex scheme that is based on the premise that the channel is a homotetramer with a single Ca2+ binding site and a single voltage sensor in each subunit. Aspects of the mslo data not well fitted by the simplified scheme will likely be better accounted for by this more general scheme. The kinetic schemes discussed in this paper may be useful in interpreting the effects of BK channel modifications or mutations.},

abstract = {Control of cerebral vasculature differs from that of systemic vessels outside the blood-brain barrier. The hypothesis that the endothelium modulates vasomotion via direct myoendothelial coupling was investigated in a small vessel of the cerebral circulation. In the primary branch of the rat basilar artery, membrane potential, diameter, and calcium dynamics associated with vasomotion were examined using selective inhibitors of endothelial function in intact and endothelium-denuded arteries. Vessel anatomy, protein, and mRNA expression were studied using conventional electron microscopy high-resolution ultrastructural and confocal immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR. Membrane potential oscillations were present in both endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and these preceded rhythmical contractions during which adjacent SMC intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) waves were synchronized. Endothelium removal abolished vasomotion and desynchronized adjacent smooth muscle cell [Ca(2+)](i) waves. N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (10 microM) did not mimic this effect, and dibutyryl cGMP (300 muM) failed to resynchronize [Ca(2+)](i) waves in endothelium-denuded arteries. Combined charybdotoxin and apamin abolished vasomotion and depolarized and constricted vessels, even in absence of endothelium. Separately, (37,43)Gap27 and (40)Gap27 abolished vasomotion. Extensive myoendothelial gap junctions (3 per endothelial cell) composed of connexins 37 and 40 connected the endothelial cell and SMC layers. Synchronized vasomotion in rat basilar artery is endothelium dependent, with [Ca(2+)](i) waves generated within SMCs being coordinated by electrical coupling via myoendothelial gap junctions.},

abstract = {Thrombin has been found in neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Also, traumatic brain injury, where neurons are exposed to high thrombin levels, is associated with an increased incidence of AD. Our objective was to determine the effects of thrombin administered in vivo on cognitive function and neuropathology. Rats were trained using a radial eight-arm maze and then thrombin (25 or 100 nM, 0.25 microl/h, 28 days) or vehicle was delivered via intracerebroventricular infusion. Animals that received 100 nM thrombin demonstrated cognitive impairments including deficits in reference memory and an increase in task latency. Also, significant neuropathology was detected in these animals such as enlargement of cerebral ventricles, an increased number of TUNEL-positive cells, astrogliosis, and an increase in the immunoreactivity for phosphorylated neurofilament, and apolipoprotein-E fragments. Thrombin-induced changes in cognitive function and ventricular enlargement were inhibited by hirudin. These findings demonstrate that thrombin is a mediator of neurotoxicity and cognitive deficits and suggest that inhibition of thrombin may be a treatment strategy for AD- or head trauma-associated cognitive deficits.},

abstract = {Amyloid beta (A$\beta$) has been proposed to play a central and causative role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. A$\beta$(25-35), the neurotoxic domain of the full-length A$\beta$, causes learning and memory impairments in rodents. The present study investigated the effects of a single bilateral i.c.v. infusion of pre-aggregated A$\beta$(25-35) (30 nmol/rat) on animals' performance in the open field, and on arginine metabolic enzymes and metabolites in the CA1, CA2/3, and dentate gyrus (DG) sub-regions of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) at the time point of 6-8 days after A$\beta$ infusion. A$\beta$(25-35) rats displayed reduced exploratory activity in the open field relative to the A$\beta$(35-25) (reverse peptide; 30 nmol) rats. A$\beta$(25-35) resulted in significantly decreased nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and endothelial NOS protein expression, but increased arginase activity, arginase II protein expression, and ornithine and putrescine levels, in hippocampal CA2/3. There were increased glutamate and putrescine levels in the DG, but decreased agmatine levels in the DG and PFC, in the A$\beta$(25-35) group relative to the A$\beta$(35-25) one. Cluster analyses were performed to determine if the nine related neurochemical variables (arginine, citrulline, ornithine, agmatine, putrescine, spermidine, spemine, glutamate, and GABA) formed distinct groups, and whether it changed as a function of A$\beta$(25-35). There were substantially different clusters between the two groups in the hippocampus and PFC. These results demonstrate that A$\beta$(25-35) alters arginine metabolism, which further supports the prominent role of arginine and its metabolites in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis.},

abstract = {The integration of usable and flexible analysis support in modelling environments is a key success factor in Model-Driven Development. In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes in midlife or late life increases the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD), and type 1 diabetes has been associated with a higher risk of detrimental cognitive outcomes, although studies from older adults are lacking. We investigated whether individuals with AD were more likely to have a history of diabetes than matched controls from the general aged population.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Information on reimbursed diabetes medication (including both type 1 and 2 diabetes) of all Finnish individuals with reimbursed AD medication in 2005 (n = 28,093) and their AD-free control subjects during 1972-2005 was obtained from a special reimbursement register maintained by the Social Insurance Institute of Finland.

RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes was 11.4\% in the whole study population, 10.7\% (n = 3,012) among control subjects, and 12.0\% (n = 3,372) among AD case subjects. People with AD were more likely to have diabetes than matched control subjects (unadjusted OR 1.14 [95\% CI 1.08-1.20]), even after adjusting for cardiovascular diseases (OR 1.31 [1.22-1.41]). The associations were stronger with diabetes diagnosed at midlife (adjusted OR 1.60 [1.34-1.84] and 1.25 [1.16-1.36] for midlife and late-life diabetes, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with clinically verified AD are more likely to have a history of clinically verified and medically treated diabetes than the general aged population, although the difference is small.},

abstract = {Diffusion in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain is constrained by the volume fraction and the tortuosity and a modified diffusion equation represents the transport behavior of many molecules in the brain. Deviations from the equation reveal loss of molecules across the blood-brain barrier, through cellular uptake, binding, or other mechanisms. Early diffusion measurements used radiolabeled sucrose and other tracers. Presently, the real-time iontophoresis (RTI) method is employed for small ions and the integrative optical imaging (IOI) method for fluorescent macromolecules, including dextrans or proteins. Theoretical models and simulations of the ECS have explored the influence of ECS geometry, effects of dead-space microdomains, extracellular matrix, and interaction of macromolecules with ECS channels. Extensive experimental studies with the RTI method employing the cation tetramethylammonium (TMA) in normal brain tissue show that the volume fraction of the ECS typically is approximately 20\% and the tortuosity is approximately 1.6 (i.e., free diffusion coefficient of TMA is reduced by 2.6), although there are regional variations. These parameters change during development and aging. Diffusion properties have been characterized in several interventions, including brain stimulation, osmotic challenge, and knockout of extracellular matrix components. Measurements have also been made during ischemia, in models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and in human gliomas. Overall, these studies improve our conception of ECS structure and the roles of glia and extracellular matrix in modulating the ECS microenvironment. Knowledge of ECS diffusion properties is valuable in contexts ranging from understanding extrasynaptic volume transmission to the development of paradigms for drug delivery to the brain.},

abstract = {Prior 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) experiments, which simultaneously measured in vivo rates of total glutamate-glutamine cycling (V(cyc(tot))) and neuronal glucose oxidation (CMR(glc(ox), N)), revealed a linear relationship between these fluxes above isoelectricity, with a slope of approximately 1. In vitro glial culture studies examining glutamate uptake indicated that glutamate, which is cotransported with Na+, stimulated glial uptake of glucose and release of lactate. These in vivo and in vitro results were consolidated into a model: recycling of one molecule of neurotransmitter between glia and neurons was associated with oxidation of one glucose molecule in neurons; however, the glucose was taken up only by glia and all the lactate (pyruvate) generated by glial glycolysis was transferred to neurons for oxidation. The model was consistent with the 1:1 relationship between DeltaCMR(glc(ox), N) and DeltaV(cyc(tot)) measured by 13C MRS. However, the model could not specify the energetics of glia and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) neurons because quantitative values for these pathways were not available. Here, we review recent 13C and 14C tracer studies that enable us to include these fluxes in a more comprehensive model. The revised model shows that glia produce at least 8\% of total oxidative ATP and GABAergic neurons generate approximately 18\% of total oxidative ATP in neurons. Neurons produce at least 88\% of total oxidative ATP, and take up approximately 26\% of the total glucose oxidized. Glial lactate (pyruvate) still makes the major contribution to neuronal oxidation, but approximately 30\% less than predicted by the prior model. The relationship observed between DeltaCMR(glc(ox), N) and DeltaV(cyc(tot)) is determined by glial glycolytic ATP as before. Quantitative aspects of the model, which can be tested by experimentation, are discussed.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous lipophilic free radical cellular messenger generated by three distinct isoforms of nitric oxide synthases (NOS), neuronal (nNOS), inducible (iNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS). NO plays an important role in the protection against the onset and progression of cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease is associated with a number of different disorders including hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension and diabetes. The underlying pathology for most cardiovascular diseases is atherosclerosis, which is in turn associated with endothelial dysfunctional. The cardioprotective roles of NO include regulation of blood pressure and vascular tone, inhibition of platelet aggregation and leukocyte adhesion, and prevention smooth muscle cell proliferation. Reduced bioavailability of NO is thought to be one of the central factors common to cardiovascular disease, although it is unclear whether this is a cause of, or result of, endothelial dysfunction. Disturbances in NO bioavailability leads to a loss of the cardio protective actions and in some case may even increase disease progression. In this chapter the cellular and biochemical mechanisms leading to reduced NO bioavailability are discussed and evidence for the prevalence of these mechanisms in cardiovascular disease evaluated.},

abstract = {Vascular endothelium expressing endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) produces nitric oxide (NO), which has a number of important physiological functions in the microvasculature. The rate of NO production by the endothelium is a critical determinant of NO distribution in the vascular wall. We have analyzed the biochemical pathways of NO synthesis and formulated a model to estimate NO production by the microvascular endothelium under physiological conditions. The model quantifies the NO produced by eNOS based on the kinetics of NO synthesis and the availability of eNOS and its intracellular substrates. The predicted NO production from microvessels was in the range of 0.005-0.1 microM/s. This range of predicted values is in agreement with some experimental values but is much lower than other rates previously measured or estimated from experimental data with the help of mathematical modeling. Paradoxical discrepancies between the model predictions and previously reported results based on experimental measurements of NO concentration in the vicinity of the arteriolar wall suggest that NO can also be released through eNOS-independent mechanisms, such as catalysis by neuronal NOS (nNOS). We also used our model to test the sensitivity of NO production to substrate availability, eNOS concentration, and potential rate-limiting factors. The results indicated that the predicted low level of NO production can be attributed primarily to a low expression of eNOS in the microvascular endothelial cells.},

Widespread heritability of neuroanatomic traits was observed, suggesting that brain structure is under strong genetic control. Furthermore, our findings indicate that neuroimaging-based measurements of cerebral variability are sensitive to genetic mediation.

abstract = {It has been postulated that the development of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may result from an imbalance between the generation and clearance of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). Although familial AD appears to be caused by Abeta overproduction, sporadic AD (the most prevalent form) may result from impairment in clearance. Recent evidence suggests that several proteases may contribute to the degradation of Abeta. Furthermore, astrocytes have recently been implicated as a potential cellular mediator of Abeta degradation. In this study, we examined the possibility that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), proteases known to be expressed and secreted by astrocytes, could play a role in extracellular Abeta degradation. We found that astrocytes surrounding amyloid plaques showed enhanced expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in aged amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 mice. Moreover, astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) degraded Abeta, lowering levels and producing several fragments after incubation with synthetic human Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42). This activity was attenuated with specific inhibitors of MMP-2 and -9, as well as in ACM derived from mmp-2 or -9 knock-out (KO) mice. In vivo, significant increases in the steady-state levels of Abeta were found in the brains of mmp-2 and -9 KO mice compared with wild-type controls. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the MMPs with N-[(2R)-2-(hydroxamidocarbonylmethyl)-4-methylpentanoyl]-L-tryptophan methylamide (GM 6001) increased brain interstitial fluid Abeta levels and elimination of half-life in APPsw mice. These results suggest that MMP-2 and -9 may contribute to extracellular brain Abeta clearance by promoting Abeta catabolism.},

abstract = {Flow-induced production of nitric oxide (NO) by endothelial cells plays a fundamental role in vascular homeostasis. However, the mechanisms by which shear stress activates NO production remain unclear due in part to limitations in measuring NO, especially under flow conditions. Shear stress elicits the release of ATP, but the relative contribution of autocrine stimulation by ATP to flow-induced NO production has not been established. Furthermore, the importance of calcium in shear stress-induced NO production remains controversial, and in particular the role of capacitive calcium entry (CCE) has yet to be determined. We have utilized our unique NO measurement device to investigate the role of ATP autocrine signaling and CCE in shear stress-induced NO production. We found that endogenously released ATP and downstream activation of purinergic receptors and CCE plays a significant role in shear stress-induced NO production. ATP-induced eNOS phophorylation under static conditions is also dependent on CCE. Inhibition of protein kinase C significantly inhibited eNOS phosphorylation and the calcium response. To our knowledge, we are the first to report on the role of CCE in the mechanism of acute shear stress-induced NO response. In addition, our work highlights the importance of ATP autocrine signaling in shear stress-induced NO production.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanism of brain glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier is of importance to understanding brain energy metabolism. The specific kinetics of glucose transport have been generally described using standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics. These models predict that the steady-state glucose concentration approaches an upper limit in the human brain when the plasma glucose level is well above the Michaelis-Menten constant for half-maximal transport, Kt. In experiments where steady-state plasma glucose content was varied from 4 to 30 mM, the brain glucose level was a linear function of plasma glucose concentration. At plasma concentrations nearing 30 mM, the brain glucose level approached 9 mM, which was significantly higher than predicted from the previously reported Kt of approximately 4 mM (p < 0.05). The high brain glucose concentration measured in the human brain suggests that ablumenal brain glucose may compete with lumenal glucose for transport. We developed a model based on a reversible Michaelis-Menten kinetic formulation of unidirectional transport rates. Fitting this model to brain glucose level as a function of plasma glucose level gave a substantially lower Kt of 0.6 +/- 2.0 mM, which was consistent with the previously reported millimolar Km of GLUT-1 in erythrocyte model systems. Previously reported and reanalyzed quantification provided consistent kinetic parameters. We conclude that cerebral glucose transport is most consistently described when using reversible Michaelis-Menten kinetics.},

abstract = {Vascular dysfunction has a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent data from brain imaging studies in humans and animal models suggest that cerebrovascular dysfunction may precede cognitive decline and onset of neurodegenerative changes in AD and AD models. Cerebral hypoperfusion and impaired amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) clearance across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may contribute to the onset and progression of dementia AD type. Decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) negatively affects the synthesis of proteins required for memory and learning, and may eventually lead to neuritic injury and neuronal death. Impaired clearance of Abeta from the brain by the cells of the neurovascular unit may lead to its accumulation on blood vessels and in brain parenchyma. The accumulation of Abeta on the cerebral blood vessels, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is associated with cognitive decline and is one of the hallmarks of AD pathology. CAA can severely disrupt the integrity of the blood vessel wall resulting in micro or macro intracerebral bleedings that exacerbates neurodegenerative process and inflammatory response and may lead to hemorrhagic stroke, respectively. Here, we review the role of the neurovascular unit and molecular mechanisms in vascular cells behind AD and CAA pathogenesis. First, we discuss apparent vascular changes, including the cerebral hypoperfusion and vascular degeneration that contribute to different stages of the disease process in AD individuals. We next discuss the role of the low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP), a key Abeta clearance receptor at the BBB and along the cerebrovascular system, whose expression is suppressed early in AD. We also discuss how brain-derived apolipoprotein E isoforms may influence Abeta clearance across the BBB. We then review the role of two interacting transcription factors, myocardin and serum response factor, in cerebral vascular cells in controlling CBF responses and LRP-mediated Abeta clearance. Finally, we discuss the role of microglia and perivascular macrophages in Abeta clearance from the brain. The data reviewed here support an essential role of neurovascular and BBB mechanisms in contributing to both, onset and progression of AD.},

abstract = {Amyloid-$\beta$ interacts with two cell surface receptors, CD36 and CD47, through which the matricellular protein thrombospondin-1 inhibits soluble guanylate cyclase activation. Here we examine whether amyloid-$\beta$ shares this inhibitory activity. Amyloid-$\beta$ inhibited both drug and nitric oxide-mediated activation of soluble guanylate cyclase in several cell types. Known cGMP-dependent functional responses to nitric oxide in platelets and vascular smooth muscle cells were correspondingly inhibited by amyloid-$\beta$. Functional interaction of amyloid-$\beta$ with the scavenger receptor CD36 was indicated by inhibition of free fatty acid uptake via this receptor. Both soluble oligomer and fibrillar forms of amyloid-$\beta$ were active. In contrast, amyloid-$\beta$ did not compete with the known ligand SIRP$\alpha$ for binding to CD47. However, both receptors were necessary for amyloid-$\beta$ to inhibit cGMP accumulation. These data suggest that amyloid-$\beta$ interaction with CD36 induces a CD47-dependent signal that inhibits soluble guanylate cyclase activation. Combined with the pleiotropic effects of inhibiting free fatty acid transport via CD36, these data provides a molecular mechanism through which amyloid-$\beta$ can contribute to the nitric oxide signaling deficiencies associated with Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Neural signalling within the central nervous system (CNS) requires a highly controlled microenvironment. Cells at three key interfaces form barriers between the blood and the CNS: the blood-brain barrier (BBB), blood-CSF barrier and the arachnoid barrier. The BBB at the level of brain microvessel endothelium is the major site of blood-CNS exchange. The structure and function of the BBB is summarised, the physical barrier formed by the endothelial tight junctions, and the transport barrier resulting from membrane transporters and vesicular mechanisms. The roles of associated cells are outlined, especially the endfeet of astrocytic glial cells, and pericytes and microglia. The embryonic development of the BBB, and changes in pathology are described. The BBB is subject to short and long-term regulation, which may be disturbed in pathology. Any programme for drug discovery or delivery, to target or avoid the CNS, needs to consider the special features of the BBB.},
