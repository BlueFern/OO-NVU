abstract = {The mechanisms by which active neurons, via astrocytes, rapidly signal intracerebral arterioles to dilate remain obscure. Here we show that modest elevation of extracellular potassium (K+) activated inward rectifier K+ (Kir) channels and caused membrane potential hyperpolarization in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of intracerebral arterioles and, in cortical brain slices, induced Kir-dependent vasodilation and suppression of SMC intracellular calcium (Ca2+) oscillations. Neuronal activation induced a rapid ({\textless}2 s latency) vasodilation that was greatly reduced by Kir channel blockade and completely abrogated by concurrent cyclooxygenase inhibition. Astrocytic endfeet exhibited large-conductance, Ca2+-sensitive K+ (BK) channel currents that could be activated by neuronal stimulation. Blocking BK channels or ablating the gene encoding these channels prevented neuronally induced vasodilation and suppression of arteriolar SMC Ca2+, without affecting the astrocytic Ca2+ elevation. These results support the concept of intercellular K+ channel-to-K+ channel signaling, through which neuronal activity in the form of an astrocytic Ca2+ signal is decoded by astrocytic BK channels, which locally release K+ into the perivascular space to activate SMC Kir channels and cause vasodilation.},

abstract = {In vivo studies on frog mesenteric arterioles (4) indicate that segmental differences in the response of microvessels to physical and chemical stimuli can be explained simply in terms of the length-tension characteristics of vascular smooth muscle at different points along the vascular tree. Studies on single, isolated arterioles in vitro were initiated to examine more closely the validity of this explanation for regional response differences. This paper reports some of the results. First-, second-, and third-order arterioles (18-60 micron i.d.) were dissected from hamster cheek pouches. The vessels were cannulated with a modified Burg microperfusion system, and their mechanical properties studied using the methods described by Duling and Gore. Vessels were activated in four stages with K+ and norepinephrine. During activation, transmural pressures were adjusted to minimize vascular smooth-muscle shortening. Active pressure-diameter curves were recorded while adjusting transmural pressure through the range 5 to 400 cm H20 in 5-25 cm steps. Vessel dimensions were measured with a videomicrometer. Passive curves were obtained after equilibration overnight in Ca2+-free medium. The vessels were then fixed and prepared for histologic sectioning, and measurements of vessel-wall composition were made. The Laplace relationship was used to construct length-tension diagrams, and the histologic data were used to normalize the dimensional data to smooth-muscle lengths. Maximum active tension of second-order arterioles (1,170 dynes/cm) was two times previous values reported by Gore et al. This was due presumably to refinements in techniques and dissection procedures. Maximum active stress averaged 3.9 X 10(+6) dynes/cm2 for second-order arterioles. This number is identical to data obtained from hog carotid strips by Dillon et al.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide is a soluble gas continuously synthesized by the endothelium. This substance has a wide range of biological properties that maintain vascular homeostasis, including modulation of vascular dilator tone, regulation of local cell growth, and protection of the vessel from injurious consequences of platelets and cells circulating in blood. A growing list of conditions, including those commonly associated as risk factors for atherosclerosis such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, are associated with diminished release of nitric oxide into the arterial wall either because of impaired synthesis or excessive oxidative degradation. Diminished nitric oxide bioactivity may cause constriction of coronary arteries during exercise or during mental stress and contribute to provocation of myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease. Additionally, diminished nitric oxide bioactivity may facilitate vascular inflammation that could lead to oxidation of lipoproteins and foam cell formation, the precursor of the atherosclerotic plaque. Numerous therapies have been investigated to assess the possibility of reversing endothelial dysfunction by enhancing the release of nitric oxide from the endothelium, either through stimulation of nitric oxide synthesis or protection of nitric oxide from oxidative inactivation and conversion to toxic molecules such as peroxynitrite. Accordingly, causal relationships between improved endothelial function and reduction in myocardial ischemia and acute coronary events can now be investigated.},

abstract = {Cerebral microvessels have a unique ultrastructure form, which allows for the close relationship of the endothelium and blood elements to the neurons they serve, via intervening astrocytes. To focal ischemia, the cerebral microvasculature rapidly displays multiple dynamic responses. Immediate events include breakdown of the primary endothelial cell permeability barrier, with transudation of plasma, expression of endothelial cell-leukocyte adhesion receptors, loss of endothelial cell and astrocyte integrin receptors, loss of their matrix ligands, expression of members of several matrix-degrading protease families, and the appearance of receptors associated with angiogenesis and neovascularization. These events occur pari passu with neuron injury. Alterations in the microvessel matrix after the onset of ischemia also suggest links to changes in nonvascular cell viability. Microvascular obstruction within the ischemic territory occurs after occlusion and reperfusion of the feeding arteries ("focal no-reflow" phenomenon). This can result from extrinsic compression and intravascular events, including leukocyte(-platelet) adhesion, platelet-fibrin interactions, and activation of coagulation. All of these events occur in microvessels heterogeneously distributed within the ischemic core. The panorama of acute microvessel responses to focal cerebral ischemia provide opportunities to understand interrelationships between neurons and their microvascular supply and changes that underlie a number of central nervous system neurodegenerative disorders.},

It is believed that the environmental risk factors play an important role in the onset and development of AD. Patients suffering from cerebral ischemia and stroke in which hypoxic conditions occur are much more susceptible to AD. Increasing evidence suggests that hypoxia facilitates the pathogenesis of AD through accelerating the accumulation of Abeta, increasing the hyperphosphorylation of tau, impairing the normal functions of blood-brain barrier, and promoting the degeneration of neurons. Further investigations into the relationship between hypoxia and AD may open the avenue for effective preservation and pharmacological treatments of this neurodegenerative disease.},

Recent advances in high-resolution imaging enable highly detailed three-dimensional geometrical representation of the whole-tumor microvascular architecture. This enormous increase in complexity of image-based data necessitates the application of informatics methods for the analysis, mining and reconstruction of these spatial graph data structures. We present a novel methodology that combines ex-vivo high-resolution micro-computed tomography imaging data with a bioimage informatics algorithm to track and reconstruct the whole-tumor vasculature of a human breast cancer model. The reconstructed tumor vascular network is used as an input of a computational model that estimates blood flow in each segment of the tumor microvascular network. This formulation involves a well-established biophysical model and an optimization algorithm that ensures mass balance and detailed monitoring of all the vessels that feed and drain blood from the tumor microvascular network. Perfusion maps for the whole-tumor microvascular network are computed. Morphological and hemodynamic indices from different regions are compared to infer their role in overall tumor perfusion.},

abstract = {Vasomotion is a rhythmic variation in microvascular diameter. Although known for more than 150 years, the cellular processes underlying the initiation of vasomotion are not fully understood. In the present study a model of a single cell is extended by coupling a number of cells into a tube. The simulated results point to a permissive role of cGMP in establishing intercellular synchronization. In sufficient concentration, cGMP may activate a cGMP-sensitive calcium-dependent chloride channel, causing a tight spatiotemporal coupling between release of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium, membrane depolarization, and influx of extracellular calcium. Low [cGMP] is associated only with unsynchronized waves. At intermediate concentrations, cells display either waves or whole cell oscillations, but these remain unsynchronized between cells. Whole cell oscillations are associated with rhythmic variation in membrane potential and flow of current through gap junctions. The amplitude of these oscillations in potential grows with increasing [cGMP], and, past a certain threshold, they become strong enough to entrain all cells in the vascular wall, thereby initiating sustained vasomotion. In this state there is a rhythmic flow of calcium through voltage-sensitive calcium channels into the cytoplasm, making the frequency of established vasomotion sensitive to membrane potential. It is concluded that electrical coupling through gap junctions is likely to be responsible for the rapid synchronization across a large number of cells. Gap-junctional current between cells is due to the appearance of oscillations in the membrane potential that again depends on the entrainment of sarcoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane within the individual cell.},

The different elements of the arginine biosynthetic system of Escherichia coli, including the connection with pyrimidine biosynthesis, and the principal regulatory mechanisms operating at genetic and enzymatic levels were integrated in a mathematical model using a molecular kinetic approach combined with a modular description of the system. The model was then used to simulate a set of perturbed conditions as follows: genetic derepression, feedback resistance of the first enzymatic step, and low constitutive synthesis of the intermediate carbamyl phosphate. In all cases, an excellent quantitative agreement between simulations and experimental results was found. The model was used to gain further insight into the function of the system, including the synergy between the different regulations. The outcome of combinations of perturbations on cellular arginine concentration was predicted accurately, establishing the model as a powerful tool for the design of arginine-overproducing strains.},

abstract = {The tight spatial and temporal coupling between neuronal activity and blood flow ensures that active brain regions receive an adequate supply of oxygen and energetic metabolites. There clearly is still an enormous amount of experimental and theoretical work to be done to unravel the precise mechanism of neurovascular coupling, but over the last decade significant advances have been made. The most recent studies confirm the original finding that the activation of Ca2+ elevations in astrocyte endfeet is an essential step but also reveal new levels of complexity in the astrocyte control of neurovascular coupling. The recent evidence for a link between Ca2+ signalling in astrocytes and local metabolic states of the brain tissue has broad implications for the interpretation of data from functional brain imaging studies. Unraveling the full molecular mechanism of the astrocyte control of cerebral blood flow represents a formidable challenge in neurobiological research in the years to come that might also create opportunities for the development of new therapeutic strategies for cerebrovascular diseases such as ischemic stroke, hypertension and migraine as well as neurodegenerative diseases as Alzheimer's disease. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in autocrine and paracrine manner in numerous physiological processes, including regulation of blood pressure and blood flow, platelet aggregation, and leukocyte adhesion. In vascular wall, most of the bioavailable NO is believed to derive from endothelial cell NO synthase (eNOS). Recently, neuronal NOS (nNOS) has been identified as a source of NO in the vicinity of microvessels and has been shown to participate in vascular function. Thus NO can be produced and transported to the vascular smooth muscle cells from 1). endothelial cells and 2). perivascular nerve fibers, mast cells, and other nNOS-containing sources. In this study, a mathematical model of NO diffusion-reaction in a cylindrical arteriolar segment was formulated. The model quantifies the relative contribution of these NO sources and the smooth muscle availability of NO in a tissue containing an arteriolar blood vessel. The results indicate that a source of NO derived through nNOS in the perivascular region can be a significant contributor to smooth muscle NO. Predicted smooth muscle NO concentrations are as high as 430 nM, which is consistent with reported experimental measurements approximately 400 nM). In addition, we used the model to analyze the smooth muscle NO availability in 1). eNOS and nNOS knockout experiments, 2). the presence of myoglobin, and 3). the presence of cell-free Hb, e.g., Hb-based oxygen carriers. The results show that NO release by nNOS would significantly affect available smooth muscle NO. Further experimental and theoretical studies are required to account for distribution of NOS isoforms and determine NO availability in vasculatures of different tissues.},

abstract = {Under parametric variations, the phase portraits of a dynamical system such as a power system undergoes qualitative changes at bifurcation points. Several global codimension-two bifurcation points such as Zero-Hopf, generalized Hopf, Bogdanov-Takens, among others, can move the system much close to its instability limit, and lead to chaos. Due to this fact, there has been major effort in understanding these instability phenomena, in order to design control and preventive actions for power systems. In this paper, the dynamics of a straightforward system which includes a single machine-infinite bus power system (SMIB) is analyzed. The system is forced to operate under several conditions in order to study its behavior close to codimension-two bifurcation points. This paper is specifically oriented to analyze the Zero-Hopf and the Bogdanov Takens bifurcations, which contributes significantly to the system dynamics.},

abstract = {In Alzheimer's disease, $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) plaques are surrounded by activated astrocytes and microglia. A growing body of evidence suggests that these activated glia contribute to neurotoxicity through the induction of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1$\beta$ and tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF$\alpha$) and the production of neurotoxic free radicals, mediated in part by the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS). Here, we address the possibility that A$\beta$-stimulated iNOS expression might result from an initial induction of IL-1$\beta$ and TNF$\alpha$. We find that in A$\beta$-stimulated astrocyte cultures, IL-1$\beta$ and TNF$\alpha$ production occur before iNOS production, new protein synthesis is required for increased iNOS mRNA levels, and the IL-1 receptor antagonist IL-1ra can inhibit nitrite accumulation. Likewise, dominant-negative mutants of tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 6, TRAF2, and NF$\kappa$B-inducing kinase (NIK), intracellular proteins involved in IL-1 and TNF$\alpha$ receptor signaling cascades, inhibit A$\beta$-stimulated iNOS promoter activity. Our data suggest that A$\beta$ stimulation of astrocyte iNOS is mediated in part by IL-1$\beta$ and TNF$\alpha$, and involves a TRAF6-, TRAF2-, and NIK-dependent signaling mechanism.},

abstract = {1. Vasomotion is the oscillation of vascular tone with frequencies in the range from 1 to 20 min(-1) seen in most vascular beds. The oscillation originates in the vessel wall and is seen both in vivo and in vitro. 2. Recently, our ideas on the cellular mechanisms responsible for vasomotion have improved. Three different types of cellular oscillations have been suggested. One model has suggested that oscillatory release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores is important (the oscillation is based on a cytosolic oscillator). A second proposed mechanism is an oscillation originating in the sarcolemma (a membrane oscillator). A third mechanism is based on an oscillation of glycolysis (metabolic oscillator). For the two latter mechanisms, only limited experimental evidence is available. 3. To understand vasomotion, it is important to understand how the cells synchronize. For the cytosolic oscillators synchronization may occur via activation of Ca2+-sensitive ion channels by oscillatory Ca2+ release. The ensuing membrane potential oscillation feeds back on the intracellular Ca2+ stores and causes synchronization of the Ca2+ release. While membrane oscillators in adjacent smooth muscle cells could be synchronized through the same mechanism that sets up the oscillation in the individual cells, a mechanism to synchronize the metabolic-based oscillators has not been suggested. 4. The interpretation of the experimental observations is supported by theoretical modelling of smooth muscle cells behaviour, and the new insight into the mechanisms of vasomotion has the potential to provide tools to investigate the physiological role of vasomotion.},

abstract = {To detect nitric oxide (NO) in the rat brain during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was employed with the NO trapping technique, using an iron and N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC) complex. An X-band (about 9.5 GHz) EPR system detected a triplet signal (g = 2.038) derived from an NO-Fe-DETC complex being superimposed on the g(perpendicular) signal of Cu-DETC complex at liquid nitrogen temperature. The height of the triplet signal peaked seven hours after injection of 40 mg/kg of LPS, and over 25 x 10(4) U/kg of IFN-gamma enhanced the LPS-induced NO formation. Pretreatment with N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA), an NO synthase inhibitor, deleted only the triplet signal. A triplet signal (g(iso) = 2.040, aN = 1.28 mT) derived from the NO-Fe-DETC complex was also observed at ambient temperature. Then, a home-built 700 MHz EPR system was used to detect an NO signal in the septic rat brain in vivo. We successfully monitored the NO-Fe-DETC signal in the head region of a living rat under the condition that provided maximum height of the NO-Fe-DETC signal in the X-band EPR study. Pretreatment with NMMA again deleted the NO-Fe-DETC signal. This is the first EPR observation of endogenous NO in the brain of living rats.},

abstract = {Glucose is the main energy substrate in the adult brain under normal conditions. Accumulating evidence, however, indicates that lactate produced in astrocytes (a type of glial cell) can also fuel neuronal activity. The quantitative aspects of this so-called astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) are still debated. To address this question, we developed a detailed biophysical model of the brain's metabolic interactions. Our model integrates three modeling approaches, the Buxton-Wang model of vascular dynamics, the Hodgkin-Huxley formulation of neuronal membrane excitability and a biophysical model of metabolic pathways. This approach provides a template for large-scale simulations of the neuron-glia-vasculature (NGV) ensemble, and for the first time integrates the respective timescales at which energy metabolism and neuronal excitability occur. The model is constrained by relative neuronal and astrocytic oxygen and glucose utilization, by the concentration of metabolites at rest and by the temporal dynamics of NADH upon activation. These constraints produced four observations. First, a transfer of lactate from astrocytes to neurons emerged in response to activity. Second, constrained by activity-dependent NADH transients, neuronal oxidative metabolism increased first upon activation with a subsequent delayed astrocytic glycolysis increase. Third, the model correctly predicted the dynamics of extracellular lactate and oxygen as observed in vivo in rats. Fourth, the model correctly predicted the temporal dynamics of tissue lactate, of tissue glucose and oxygen consumption, and of the BOLD signal as reported in human studies. These findings not only support the ANLS hypothesis but also provide a quantitative mathematical description of the metabolic activation in neurons and glial cells, as well as of the macroscopic measurements obtained during brain imaging.},

abstract = {Fast excitatory synapses are generally thought to act as private communication channels between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. Some recent findings, however, suggest that glutamate may diffuse out of the synaptic cleft and bind to several subtypes of receptors, either in the perisynaptic membrane or at neighboring synapses. it is not known whether activation of these receptors can occur in response to the release of a single vesicle of glutamate. Here we estimate the spatiotemporal profile of glutamate in the extrasynaptic space after vesicle exocytosis, guided by detailed ultrastructural measurements of the CA1 neuropil in the adult rat. We argue that the vicinity of the synapse can be treated as an isotropic porous medium, in which diffusion is determined by the extracellular volume fraction and the tortuosity factor, and develop novel stereological methods to estimate these parameters. We also estimate the spatial separation between synapses, to ask whether glutamate released at one synapse can activate NMDA and other high-affinity receptors at a neighboring synapse. Kinetic simulations of extrasynaptic glutamate uptake show that transporters rapidly reduce the free concentration of transmitter. Exocytosis of a single vesicle is, however, sufficient to bind to high-affinity receptors situated in the immediate perisynaptic space. The distance separating a typical synapse from its nearest neighbor is similar to 465 nm. Whether glutamate can reach a sufficient concentration to activate NMDA receptors at this distance depends critically on the diffusion coefficient in the extracellular space. If diffusion is much slower than in free aqueous solution, NMDA receptors could mediate crosstalk between neighboring synapses.},

abstract = {The brain is critically dependent on a continuous supply of blood to function. Therefore, the cerebral vasculature is endowed with neurovascular control mechanisms that assure that the blood supply of the brain is commensurate to the energy needs of its cellular constituents. The regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) during brain activity involves the coordinated interaction of neurons, glia, and vascular cells. Thus, whereas neurons and glia generate the signals initiating the vasodilation, endothelial cells, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells act in concert to transduce these signals into carefully orchestrated vascular changes that lead to CBF increases focused to the activated area and temporally linked to the period of activation. Neurovascular coupling is disrupted in pathological conditions, such as hypertension, Alzheimer disease, and ischemic stroke. Consequently, CBF is no longer matched to the metabolic requirements of the tissue. This cerebrovascular dysregulation is mediated in large part by the deleterious action of reactive oxygen species on cerebral blood vessels. A major source of cerebral vascular radicals in models of hypertension and Alzheimer disease is the enzyme NADPH oxidase. These findings, collectively, highlight the importance of neurovascular coupling to the health of the normal brain and suggest a therapeutic target for improving brain function in pathologies associated with cerebrovascular dysfunction.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) produced by the endothelium is involved in the regulation of vascular tone. Decreased NO production or availability has been linked to endothelial dysfunction in hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. Shear stress-induced NO release is a well-established phenomenon, yet the cellular mechanisms of this response are not completely understood. Experimental limitations have hindered direct, real-time measurements of NO under flow conditions. We have overcome these challenges with a new design for a parallel-plate flow chamber. The chamber consists of two compartments, separated by a Transwell?? membrane, which isolates a NO recording electrode located in the upper compartment from flow effects. Endothelial cells are grown on the bottom of the membrane, which is inserted into the chamber flush with the upper plate. We demonstrate for the first time direct real-time NO measurements from endothelial cells with controlled variations in shear stress. Step changes in shear stress from 0.1dyn/cm2 to 6, 10, or 20dyn/cm2 elicited a transient decrease in NO followed by an increase to a new steady state. An analysis of NO transport suggests that the initial decrease is due to the increased removal rate by convection as flow increases. Furthermore, the rate at which the NO concentration approaches the new steady state is related to the time-dependent cellular response rather than transport limitations of the measurement configuration. Our design offers a method for studying the kinetics of the signaling mechanisms linking NO production with shear stress as well as pathological conditions involving changes in NO production or availability. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Increased levels of glutamate and the subsequent activation of NMDA receptors are responsible for neuronal damage that occurs after an ischemic or hypoxic episode. In the present work, we investigated the relative contribution of presynaptic and postsynaptic blockade of synaptic transmission, as well as of blockade of NMDA receptors, for the facilitation of recovery of synaptic transmission in the CA1 area of rat hippocampal slices exposed to prolonged (90 min) hypoxia. During hypoxia, there was a complete inhibition of field EPSPs, which was fully reversible if released adenosine was allowed to act. When adenosine A(1) receptors were blocked with the selective antagonist 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX), recovery of synaptic transmission from hypoxia was significantly attenuated, and this impairment could be overcome by preventing synaptic transmission during hypoxia either with tetrodotoxin (TTX) or by switching off the afferent stimulation but not by postsynaptic blockade of transmission with 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) or selective blockade of adenosine A(2A) receptors. When synaptic transmission was allowed to occur during hypoxia, because of the presence of DPCPX, there was an NMDA receptor-mediated component of the EPSCs recorded in CA1 pyramidal neurons, and blockade of NMDA receptors with AP-5 restored recovery of synaptic transmission from hypoxia. It is concluded that impairment of recovery of synaptic transmission after an hypoxic insult results from activation of synaptic NMDA receptors by synaptically released glutamate and that adenosine by preventing this activation efficiently facilitates recovery.},

abstract = {The cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unknown. This gap in knowledge has created a stumbling block in the search for a genuinely effective treatment or cure for this dementia. This article summarises the arguments for a causal role for either amyloid deposition or cerebrovascular pathology as the primary trigger in the development of non-genetic AD. A bare-bones survey of the published research reveals no compelling evidence that amyloid deposition is neurotoxic in human beings or that it results in neurodegenerative changes involving synaptic, metabolic, or neuronal loss in human or transgenic-mouse brains. By contrast, the data supporting AD as a primary vascular disorder are more convincing. Findings suggesting a vascular cause of AD come from epidemiological, neuroimaging, pathological, pharmacotherapeutic, and clinical studies. The consensus of these studies indicates that chronic brain hypoperfusion is linked to AD risk factors, AD preclinical detection and pharmacotherapeutic action of AD symptoms.},

Cardiol. 92:59-61) has been proposed to be a regulator of calcium homeostasis and signal transduction networks of the cell. However, little is known about its precise mechanisms of action. Knock-out of (mainly neuronal) isoform 2 of the enzyme resulted in hearing loss and balance deficits due to severe inner ear defects, affecting formation and maintenance of otoconia (Kozel, P.J., R.A. Friedman, L.C. Erway, E.N. Yamoah, L.H. Liu, T. Riddle, J.J. Duffy, T. Doetschman, M.L. Miller, E.L. Cardell, and G.E. Shull. 1998. J. Biol. Chem. 273:18693-18696). Here we demonstrate that PMCA 4b is a negative regulator of nitric oxide synthase I (NOS-I, nNOS) in HEK293 embryonic kidney and neuro-2a neuroblastoma cell models. Binding of PMCA 4b to NOS-I was mediated by interaction of the COOH-terminal amino acids of PMCA 4b and the PDZ domain of NOS-I (PDZ: PSD 95/Dlg/ZO-1 protein domain). Increasing expression of wild-type PMCA 4b (but not PMCA mutants unable to bind PDZ domains or devoid of Ca2+-transporting activity) dramatically downregulated NO synthesis from wild-type NOS-I. A NOS-I mutant lacking the PDZ domain was not regulated by PMCA, demonstrating the specific nature of the PMCA-NOS-I interaction. Elucidation of PMCA as an interaction partner and major regulator of NOS-I provides evidence for a new dimension of integration between calcium and NO signaling pathways.},

abstract = {We previously showed that pancreatic beta-cells express a neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) that controls insulin secretion by exerting two enzymatic activities: nitric oxide (NO) production and cytochrome c reductase activity. We now bring evidence that two inhibitors of nNOS, N-omega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) and 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), increase glucose-induced insulin secretion but affect beta-cell function differently. In the presence of l-NAME, insulin response is monophasic, whereas 7-NI preserves the normal biphasic secretory pattern. In addition, the alterations of beta-cell functional response induced by the inhibitors also differ by their sensitivity to a substitutive treatment with sodium nitroprusside, a chemical NO donor. These differences are probably related to the nature of the two inhibitors. Indeed, using low-temperature SDS-PAGE and real-time analysis of nNOS dimerization by surface plasmon resonance, we could show that 7-NI, which competes with arginine and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), an essential cofactor for nNOS dimer formation, inhibits dimerization of the enzyme, whereas the substrate-based inhibitor l-NAME stabilizes the homodimeric state of nNOS. The latter effect could be reproduced by the two endogenous inhibitors of NOS, N-omega-methyl-l-arginine and asymmetric dimethylarginine, and resulted interestingly in a reduced ability of the protein inhibitor of nNOS (PIN) to dissociate nNOS dimers. We conclude that intracellular factors able to induce abnormalities in the nNOS monomer/dimer equilibrium could lead to pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction.},

Astrocytes are organized into distinct nonoverlapping domains and extend elaborate and dense fine processes that interact intimately with synapses and cerebrovasculature. The recognition in the mid 1990s that astrocytes undergo elevations in intracellular calcium concentration following activation of G protein-coupled receptors by synaptically released neurotransmitters demonstrated not only that astrocytes display a form of excitability but also that astrocytes may be active participants in brain information processing. The roles that astrocytic calcium elevations play in neurophysiology and especially in modulation of neuronal activity have been intensely researched in recent years. This review will summarize the current understanding of the function of astrocytic calcium signaling in neurophysiological processes and discuss areas where the role of astrocytes remains controversial and will therefore benefit from further study. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Functional neuroimaging relies on the robust coupling between neuronal activity, metabolism and cerebral blood flow (CBF), but the physiological basis of the neuroimaging signals is still poorly understood. We examined the mechanisms of activity-dependent changes in tissue oxygenation in relation to variations in CBF responses and postsynaptic activity in rat cerebellar cortex. To increase synaptic activity we stimulated the monosynaptic, glutamatergic climbing fibres that excite Purkinje cells via AMPA receptors. We used local field potentials to indicate synaptic activity, and recorded tissue oxygen partial pressure (P(tiss,O2)) by polarographic microelectrodes, and CBF using laser-Doppler flowmetry. The disappearance rate of oxygen in the tissue increased linearly with synaptic activity. This indicated that, without a threshold, oxygen consumption increased as a linear function of synaptic activity. The reduction in P(tiss,O2) preceded the rise in CBF. The time integral (area) of the negative P(tiss,O2) response increased non-linearly showing saturation at high levels of synaptic activity, concomitant with a steep rise in CBF. This was accompanied by a positive change in P(tiss,O2). Neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibition enhanced the initial negative P(tiss,O2) response ('dip'), while attenuating the evoked CBF increase and positive P(tiss,O2) response equally. This indicates that increases in CBF counteract activity-induced reductions in P(tiss,O2), and suggests the presence of a tissue oxygen reserve. The changes in P(tiss,O2) and CBF were strongly attenuated by AMPA receptor blockade. Our findings suggest an inverse relationship between negative P(tiss,O2) and CBF responses, and provide direct in vivo evidence for a tight coupling between activity in postsynaptic AMPA receptors and cerebellar oxygen consumption.},

The challenge is to unravel the link. Here we show, using spectrophotometry to record oxyhaemoglobin and methemoglobin (surrogate markers of cerebral flow and nitric oxide levels respectively) together with extracellular neuronal recordings in vivo and applying a multiple polynomial regression model, that the markers are able to predict up about 80{\%} of variability in NR. Furthermore, we show that the coupling between blood flow and neuronal activity is heavily influenced by nitric oxide (NO). While NRs show the typical saturating response, blood flow shows a linear behaviour during contrast-response curves, with nitric oxide from different sources acting differently for low and high intensity.},

In addition, it was realized that peripheral immune cells play important roles, not only after their invasion into the brain but also because of stroke-induced effects on the immune system that can result in infections. Indeed, outcome of stroke patients is not only dictated by nonmodifiable factors, such as severity of stroke, age, or premorbidity, but also by modifiable factors largely related to medical complications, such as infections and possibly sarcopenia. The highly successful concept of stroke units attests to the benefits of treating stroke comprehensively. Breakthroughs in improving outcome after stroke will only result from approaches that target not only the brain, but also systemic effects of stroke.},

abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is formed by brain endothelial cells lining the cerebral microvasculature, and is an important mechanism for protecting the brain from fluctuations in plasma composition, and from circulating agents such as neurotransmitters and xenobiotics capable of disturbing neural function. The barrier also plays an important role in the homeostatic regulation of the brain microenvironment necessary for the stable and co-ordinated activity of neurones. The BBB phenotype develops under the influence of associated brain cells, especially astrocytic glia, and consists of more complex tight junctions than in other capillary endothelia, and a number of specific transport and enzyme systems which regulate molecular traffic across the endothelial cells. Transporters characteristic of the BBB phenotype include both uptake mechanisms (e.g. GLUT-1 glucose carrier, L1 amino acid transporter) and efflux transporters (e.g. P-glycoprotein). In addition to a role in long-term barrier induction and maintenance, astrocytes and other cells can release chemical factors that modulate endothelial permeability over a time-scale of seconds to minutes. Cell culture models, both primary and cell lines, have been used to investigate aspects of barrier induction and modulation. Conditioned medium taken from growing glial cells can reproduce some of the inductive effects, evidence for involvement of diffusible factors. However, for some features of endothelial differentiation and induction, the extracellular matrix plays an important role. Several candidate molecules have been identified, capable of mimicking aspects of glial-mediated barrier induction of brain endothelium; these include TGFbeta, GDNF, bFGF, IL-6 and steroids. In addition, factors secreted by brain endothelial cells including leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) have been shown to induce astrocytic differentiation. Thus endothelium and astrocytes are involved in two-way induction. Short-term modulation of brain endothelial permeability has been shown for a number of small chemical mediators produced by astrocytes and other nearby cell types. It is clear that endothelial cells are involved in both long- and short-term chemical communication with neighbouring cells, with the perivascular end feet of astrocytes being of particular importance. The role of barrier induction and modulation in normal physiology and in pathology is discussed.},

abstract = {Functional hyperemia is an important metabolic autoregulation mechanism by which increased neuronal activity is matched by a rapid and regional increase in blood supply. This mechanism is facilitated by a process known as "neurovascular coupling"-the orchestrated communication system involving neurons, astrocytes and arterioles. Important steps in this process are the production of EETs in the astrocyte and the release of potassium, via two potassium channels (BK and KIR), into the perivascular space. We provide a model which successfully accounts for several observations seen in experiment. The model is capable of simulating the approximate 15{\%} arteriolar dilation caused by a 60-s neuronal activation (modelled as a release of potassium and glutamate into the synaptic cleft). This model also successfully emulates the paradoxical experimental finding that vasoconstriction follows vasodilation when the astrocytic calcium concentration (or perivascular potassium concentration) is increased further. We suggest that the interaction of the changing smooth muscle cell membrane potential and the changing potassium-dependent resting potential of the KIR channel are responsible for this effect. Finally, we demonstrate that a well-controlled mechanism of potassium buffering is potentially important for successful neurovascular coupling. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The brain is a heterogeneous organ with regionally varied and constantly changing energetic needs. Blood vessels in the brain are equipped with control mechanisms that match oxygen and glucose delivery through blood flow with the local metabolic demands that are imposed by neural activity. However, the cellular bases of this mechanism have remained elusive. A major advance has been the demonstration that astrocytes, cells with extensive contacts with both synapses and cerebral blood vessels, participate in the increases in flow evoked by synaptic activity. Their organization in nonoverlapping spatial domains indicates that they are uniquely positioned to shape the spatial distribution of the vascular responses that are evoked by neural activity. Astrocytic calcium is an important determinant of microvascular function and may regulate flow independently of synaptic activity. The involvement of astrocytes in neurovascular coupling has broad implications for the interpretation of functional imaging signals and for the understanding of brain diseases that are associated with neurovascular dysfunction.},

abstract = {Endothelial cells release nitric oxide (NO) more potently in response to increased shear stress than to agonists which elevate intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). To determine mechanistic differences in the regulation of endothelial constitutive NO synthase (ecNOS), we measured NO production by bovine aortic endothelial cells exposed to shear stress in a laminar flow chamber or treated with Ca2+ ionophores in static culture. The kinetics of cumulative NO production varied strikingly: shear stress (25 dyne/cm2) stimulated a biphasic increase over control that was 13-fold at 60 minutes, whereas raising [Ca2+]i caused a monophasic 6-fold increase. We hypothesized that activation of a protein kinase cascade mediates the early phase of flow-dependent NO production. Immunoprecipitation of ecNOS showed a 210{\%} increase in phosphorylation 1 minute after flow initiation, whereas there was no significant increase after Ca2+ ionophore treatment. Although ecNOS was not tyrosine-phosphorylated, the early phase of flow-dependent NO production was blocked by genistein, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases. To determine the Ca2+ requirement for flow-dependent NO production, we measured [Ca2+]i with a novel flow-step protocol. [Ca2+]i increased with the onset of shear stress, but not after a step increase. However, the step increase in shear stress was associated with a potent biphasic increase in NO production rate and ecNOS phosphorylation. These studies demonstrate that shear stress can increase NO production in the absence of increased [Ca2+]i, and they suggest that phosphorylation of ecNOS may importantly modulate its activity during the imposition of increased shear stress.},

abstract = {Extracellular potassium concentration, [K(+)](o), and intracellular calcium, [Ca(2+)](i), rise during neuron excitation, seizures and spreading depression. Astrocytes probably restrain the rise of K(+) in a way that is only partly understood. To examine the effect of glial K(+) uptake, we used a model neuron equipped with Na(+), K(+), Ca(2+) and Cl(-) conductances, ion pumps and ion exchangers, surrounded by interstitial space and glia. The glial membrane was either "passive", incorporating only leak channels and an ion exchange pump, or it had rectifying K(+) channels. We computed ion fluxes, concentration changes and osmotic volume changes. Increase of [K(+)](o) stimulated the glial uptake by the glial 3Na/2K ion pump. The [K(+)](o) flux through glial leak and rectifier channels was outward as long as the driving potential was outwardly directed, but it turned inward when rising [K(+)](o)/[K(+)](i) ratio reversed the driving potential. Adjustments of glial membrane parameters influenced the neuronal firing patterns, the length of paroxysmal afterdischarge and the ignition point of spreading depression. We conclude that voltage gated K(+) currents can boost the effectiveness of the glial "potassium buffer" and that this buffer function is important even at moderate or low levels of excitation, but especially so in pathological states.},

abstract = {A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach was presented to model the blood flows in the carotid bifurcation and the brain arteries under altered gravity. Physical models required for CFD simulation were introduced including a model for arterial wall motion due to fluid-wall interactions, a shear thinning fluid model of blood, a vascular bed model for outflow boundary conditions, and a model for autoregulation mechanism. The three-dimensional unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled with these models were solved iteratively using the pseudocompressibility method and dual time stepping. Gravity source terms were added to the Navier-Stokes equations to take the effect of gravity into account. For the treatment of complex geometry, a chimera overset grid technique was adopted to obtain connectivity between arterial branches. For code validation, computed results were compared with experimental data for both steady-state and time-dependent flows. This computational approach was then applied to blood flows through a realistic carotid bifurcation and two Circle of Willis models, one using an idealized geometry and the other using an anatomical data set. A three-dimensional Circle of Willis configuration was reconstructed from subject-specific magnetic resonance images using an image segmentation method. Through the numerical simulation of blood flow in two model problems, namely, the carotid bifurcation and the brain arteries, it was observed that the altered gravity has considerable effects on arterial contraction/dilatation and consequent changes in flow conditions.},

abstract = {The Circle of Willis is a ring-like structure of blood vessels found beneath the hypothalamus at the base of the brain. Its main function is to distribute oxygen-rich arterial blood to the cerebral mass. One-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of the Circle of Willis have been created to provide a simulation tool which can potentially be used to identify at-risk cerebral arterial geometries and conditions and replicate clinical scenarios, such as occlusions in afferent arteries and absent circulus vessels. Both models capture cerebral haemodynamic autoregulation using a proportional-integral (PI) controller to modify efferent artery resistances to maintain optimal efferent flow rates for a given circle geometry and afferent blood pressure. The models can be used to identify at-risk cerebral arterial geometries and conditions prior to surgery or other clinical procedures. The 1D model is particularly relevant in this instance, with its fast solution time suitable for real-time clinical decisions. Results show the excellent correlation between models for the transient efferent flux profile. The assumption of strictly Poiseuille flow in the 1D model allows more flow through the geometrically extreme communicating arteries than the 3D model. This discrepancy was overcome by increasing the resistance to flow in the anterior communicating artery in the 1D model to better match the resistance seen in the 3D results.},

abstract = {A substantial body of evidence supports the hypothesis of a vascular component in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebral hypoperfusion and blood-brain barrier dysfunction have been indicated as key elements of this pathway. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a cerebrovascular disorder, frequent in AD, characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in cerebral blood vessel walls. CAA is associated with loss of vascular integrity, resulting in impaired regulation of cerebral circulation, and increased susceptibility to cerebral ischemia, microhemorrhages, and white matter damage. Vasomotion-the spontaneous rhythmic modulation of arterial diameter, typically observed in arteries/arterioles in various vascular beds including the brain-is thought to participate in tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery regulation. Vasomotion is impaired in adverse conditions such as hypoperfusion and hypoxia. The perivascular and glymphatic pathways of Abeta clearance are thought to be driven by the systolic pulse. Vasomotion produces diameter changes of comparable amplitude, however at lower rates, and could contribute to these mechanisms of Abeta clearance. In spite of potential clinical interest, studies addressing cerebral vasomotion in the context of AD/CAA are limited. This study reviews the current literature on vasomotion, and hypothesizes potential paths implicating impaired cerebral vasomotion in AD/CAA. Abeta and oxidative stress cause vascular tone dysregulation through direct effects on vascular cells, and indirect effects mediated by impaired neurovascular coupling. Vascular tone dysregulation is further aggravated by cholinergic deficit and results in depressed cerebrovascular reactivity and (possibly) impaired vasomotion, aggravating regional hypoperfusion and promoting further Abeta and oxidative stress accumulation},

abstract = {Both the skeletal muscle and skin of humans possess remarkable abilities to vasodilate. Marked vasodilation can be seen in these vascular beds in response to a variety of common physiological stimuli. These stimuli include reactive hyperemia (skin and muscle), exercise hyperemia (muscle), mental stress (muscle), and whole body heating (skin). The physiological mechanisms that cause vasodilation in response to these stimuli are poorly understood, and the substance(s) responsible for it remain unclear. In this context, recent attention has been focused on the possible contribution of nitric oxide (NO) to the regulation of hyperemic responses in human skin and skeletal muscle. The emerging picture is that NO is not an essential component of the dilator response seen during reactive hyperemia. However, it does appear that NO may play a modest role in exercise hyperemia. NO appears to play a major role in the skeletal muscle vasodilation seen in response to mental stress in humans. Preliminary evidence also indicates that NO is not essential for the normal dilator responses observed in the cutaneous circulation during body heating in humans, but this issue needs further study. There are a number of possible mechanisms that might mediate NO release in humans, and the role of these mechanisms in the various hyperemic responses is also poorly understood. The role of altered NO-mediated vasodilation in some disease states is also discussed. Whereas NO is a potent vasodilating substance, the actions of NO alone do not explain a variety of poorly understood vasodilator mechanisms in conscious humans. Much work remains for those interested in the role of NO in the regulation of blood flow to the skin and skeletal muscle of humans.},

abstract = {The question of the preferred substrate of glutamatergic neurons at high neural activity has been vibrantly debated for over a decade since the classical hypothesis (CH) of the primacy of glucose has been challenged by the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis (ANLSH), which replaces the primacy of glucose with astrocyte produced lactate. We perform Bayesian Flux Balance Analysis (BFBA) with a new mathematical model of cellular brain energetics, comprising detailed biochemical pathways in and between astrocytes and glutamatergic neurons and partitioning of each cell type into cytosol and mitochondria. Supported by the results of our in silico studies, which are in remarkable agreement with previously published results, we posit the Glucose Shunt Hypothesis (GSH) that during high activity, the inhibition of the phosphofructokinase (PFK) enzyme in neuron impairs neuronal glycolysis, enabling the process by which lactate effluxed by astrocytes is taken up by glutamatergic neurons, whereas at low activity, glucose remains the preferred substrate for neurons. We postulate that the ANLS is a shunt utilized by glutamatergic neurons to bypass their glycolysis impaired by the inhibition of PFK in connection with increased oxidative phosphorylation at high neuronal activity.},

abstract = {The focal location of atherosclerosis in the vascular tree is correlated with local variations in shear stress. We developed a method to induce defined variations in shear stress in a straight vessel segment of a mouse. To this end, a cylinder with a tapered lumen was placed around the carotid artery, inducing a high shear stress field. Concomitantly, regions of low shear stress and oscillatory shear stress were created upstream and down-stream of the device, respectively. This device was used in mice transgenic for an eNOS3GFP fusion gene. We observed a strong induction of endothelial nitric oxide synthase-green fluorescent protein (eNOS-GFP) mRNA expression in the high shear stress region compared with the other regions (P {\textless} .05). Quantification of eNOS-GFP fluorescence or of immunoreactivity to the Golgi complex or to platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) showed an increase in the high shear stress region (P {\textless} .05) compared with nontreated carotid arteries. Colocalization of eNOS-GFP with either the Golgi complex or PECAM-1 also responded to alterations of shear stress. In conclusion, we showed a direct response of mRNA and protein expression in vivo to induced variations of shear stress. This model provides the opportunity to study the relationship between shear stress alterations, gene expression, and atherosclerosis.},

abstract = {A major breakthrough in neuroscience has been the realization in the last decades that the dogmatic view of astroglial cells as being merely fostering and buffering elements of the nervous system is simplistic. A wealth of investigations now shows that astrocytes actually participate in the control of synaptic transmission in an active manner. This was first hinted by the intimate contacts glial processes make with neurons, particularly at the synaptic level, and evidenced using electrophysiological and calcium imaging techniques. Calcium imaging has provided critical evidence demonstrating that astrocytic regulation of synaptic efficacy is not a passive phenomenon. However, given that cellular activation is not only represented by calcium signaling, it is also crucial to assess concomitant mechanisms. We and others have used electrophysiological techniques to simultaneously record neuronal and astrocytic activity, thus enabling the study of multiple ionic currents and in depth investigation of neuro-glial dialogues. In the current review, we focus on the input such approach has provided in the understanding of astrocyte-neuron interactions underlying control of synaptic efficacy.},

abstract = {Brain imaging techniques rely on changes in blood flow, volume and oxygenation to infer the loci and magnitude of changes in activity. Although progress has been made in understanding the link between stimulus-evoked neural activity and haemodynamics, the extent to which neurovascular-coupling relationships remain constant during different states of baseline cortical activity is poorly understood. Optical imaging spectroscopy, laser Doppler flowmetry and electrophysiology were used to measure haemodynamics and neural activity in the barrel cortex of anaesthetized rats. The responses to stimulation of the whisker pad were recorded during quiescence and cortical desynchronization produced by stimulation of the brainstem. Cortical desynchronization was accompanied by increases in baseline blood flow, volume and oxygenation. Haemodynamic responses to low-frequency whisker stimuli (1 Hz) were attenuated during arousal compared with that observed during quiescence. During arousal it was possible to increase stimulus-evoked haemodynamics by increasing the frequency of the stimulus. Neural responses to low-frequency stimuli were also attenuated but to a far lesser extent than the reduction in the accompanying haemodynamics. In contrast, neuronal activity evoked by high-frequency stimuli (40 Hz) was enhanced during arousal, but induced haemodynamic responses of a similar magnitude compared with that observed for the same high-frequency stimulus presented during quiescence. These data suggest that there may be differences in stimulus-evoked neural activity and accompanying haemodynamics during different information-processing states.},

abstract = {Glia in the central nervous system (CNS) express diverse inward rectifying potassium channels (Kir). The major function of Kir is in establishing the high potassium (K+) selectivity of the glial cell membrane and strongly negative resting membrane potential (RMP), which are characteristic physiological properties of glia. The classical property of Kir is that K+ flows inwards when the RMP is negative to the equilibrium potential for K+ (E(K)), but at more positive potentials outward currents are inhibited. This provides the driving force for glial uptake of K+ released during neuronal activity, by the processes of "K+ spatial buffering" and "K+ siphoning", considered a key function of astrocytes, the main glial cell type in the CNS. Glia express multiple Kir channel subtypes, which are likely to have distinct functional roles related to their differences in conductance, and sensitivity to intracellular and extracellular factors, including pH, ATP, G-proteins, neurotransmitters and hormones. A feature of CNS glia is their specific expression of the Kir4.1 subtype, which is a major K+ conductance in glial cell membranes and has a key role in setting the glial RMP. It is proposed that Kir4.1 have a primary function in K+ regulation, both as homomeric channels and as heteromeric channels by co-assembly with Kir5.1 and probably Kir2.0 subtypes. Significantly, Kir4.1 are also expressed by oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells of the CNS, and the genetic ablation of Kir4.1 results in severe hypomyelination. Hence, Kir, and in particular Kir4.1, are key regulators of glial functions, which in turn determine neuronal excitability and axonal conduction.},

abstract = {The nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP pathway in the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) is an important cellular signaling system for the regulation of VSMC relaxation. We present a mathematical model to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this pathway. The model describes the flow of NO-driven signal transduction: NO activation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), sGC- and phosphodiesterase-catalyzed cGMP production and degradation, cGMP-mediated regulation of protein targets including the Ca2+-activated K+ (KCa) channel, and the myosin contractile system. Model simulations reproduce major NO/cGMP-induced VSMC relaxation effects, including intracellular Ca2+ concentration reduction and Ca2+ desensitization of myosin phosphorylation and force generation. Using the model, we examine several testable principles. 1) Rapid sGC desensitization is caused by end-product cGMP feedback inhibition; a large fraction of the steady-state sGC population is in an inactivated intermediate state, and cGMP production is limited well below maximum. 2) NO activates the K(Ca) channel with both cGMP-dependent and -independent mechanisms; moderate NO concentration affects the K(Ca) via the cGMP-dependent pathway, whereas higher NO concentration is accommodated by a cGMP-independent mechanism. 3) Chronic NO synthase inhibition may cause underexpressions of K+ channels including inward rectifier and K(Ca) channels. 4) Ca2+ desensitization of the contractile system is distinguished from Ca2+ sensitivity of myosin phosphorylation. The model integrates these interactions among the heterogeneous components of the NO signaling system and can serve as a general modeling framework for studying NO-mediated VSMC relaxation under various physiological and pathological conditions. New data can be readily incorporated into this framework for interpretation and possible modification and improvement of the model.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is a relative newcomer to pharmacology, as the paper which initiated the field was published only 25 years ago. Nevertheless its impact is such that to date more than 31,000 papers have been published with NO in the title and more than 65,000 refer to it in some way. The identification of NO with endothelium-derived relaxing factor and the discovery of its synthesis from L-arginine led to the realisation that the L-arginine: NO pathway is widespread and plays a variety of physiological roles. These include the maintenance of vascular tone, neurotransmitter function in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, and mediation of cellular defence. In addition, NO interacts with mitochondrial systems to regulate cell respiration and to augment the generation of reactive oxygen species, thus triggering mechanisms of cell survival or death. This review will focus on the role of NO in the cardiovascular system where, in addition to maintaining a vasodilator tone, it inhibits platelet aggregation and adhesion and modulates smooth muscle cell proliferation. NO has been implicated in a number of cardiovascular diseases and virtually every risk factor for these appears to be associated with a reduction in endothelial generation of NO. Reduced basal NO synthesis or action leads to vasoconstriction, elevated blood pressure and thrombus formation. By contrast, overproduction of NO leads to vasodilatation, hypotension, vascular leakage, and disruption of cell metabolism. Appropriate pharmacological or molecular biological manipulation of the generation of NO will doubtless prove beneficial in such conditions.},

abstract = {Arterioles display cyclic variations in diameter, termed vasomotion initiated by smooth muscle cells (SMCs), but the endothelium should also be evaluated due to its modulatory role on vessel tone. Since nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI2) regulate SMC tone and activate K+ currents, we have investigated their role on vasomotion, by observing effects of topical application of N$\omega$-nitro-l-arginine (L-NA, NO synthesis inhibitor), glibenclamide (KATP channel inhibitor), sodium nitroprusside (SNP, NO donor), iloprost (PGI2 analogue) and methylene blue (MB, cGMP production inhibitor) on the cheek pouch preparation of anesthetized male hamsters. L-NA (10-10-10-6M) induced vasoconstriction, reduction and abolition of vasomotion. MB (10-7 to 10-5M) reduced mean arteriolar diameter with no changes on vasomotion. In the presence of 10-6M of MB, addition of 10-6L-NA totally abolished vasomotion without further constriction. Glibenclamide (10-6M) in the presence of L-NA at equimolar concentration restored both vasomotion frequency and amplitude. This effect was not observed in the presence of TEA 5mM. SNP (10-10-10-6M) induced a dose-dependent increase of arteriolar diameter and decreased vasomotion. Iloprost (10-12-10-6M) induced a concentration dependent increase of arteriolar diameter, reduced vasomotion frequency, but in lower concentrations (10-12-10-10M) increased its amplitude and in higher concentrations (10-9-10-6M) decreased it. SNP and iloprost inhibited vasomotion at 10-7M; however, at this concentration SNP and iloprost induced an increment of 35{\%} and 50{\%} of the initial arteriolar diameter, respectively. In the presence of L-NA (10-6M), vasomotion was restored by SNP at 10-10M and iloprost 10-12M, which corresponded to 80{\%} of the initial diameter value. Around the initial (control) arteriolar diameter value, vasomotion presented its highest frequencies and amplitudes. Cessation of vasomotion occurred with L-NA (10-6M) in the presence of SNP (10-6M) and iloprost (10-7M) when arteriolar diameter reached 150{\%} and 120{\%} of its initial value, respectively. In conclusion, the present study strongly suggests that vasomotion (1) is not solely related to vascular tone, (2) needs an interplay between vascular tone and membrane currents and (3) could be modulated by NO (but not cGMP) and KATP channels.

Initially, we categorize the cerebral circulation and then review the vascular anatomy. We draw attention to a number of unique features of the cerebral vasculature, which are relevant to the microcirculatory response during ischemia: arterial histology, species differences, collateral flow, the venous drainage, the blood-brain barrier, astrocytes and vascular nerves. The physiology of the arterial microcirculation is then assessed. Lastly, we review the changes during ischemia which impact on the microcirculation. Further understanding of the normal cerebrovascular anatomy and physiology as well as the pathophysiology of ischemia will allow the rational development of a pharmacologic therapy for human stroke and brain injury. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Cells have intrinsic signalling mechanisms that are capable of sensing various deleterious conditions, both normal and pathological, and respond by mounting a variety of stress responses. Examples of normal signals are the cytokines that induce inflammatory responses in cells. Pathological signals include UV and X-ray irradiation, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), abrupt anoxia and physicochemical injury through heat or noxious chemicals. A process of wound healing can function to repair the damage caused by such injuries. In many cases, especially if the stress signal is not too severe, the cell can survive and can even become tolerant to further insults. If cells are growing, such sub-lethal insults can either cause the cell to stop growing temporarily to allow adequate time to repair the damage, or the process of cell proliferation can be stopped more permanently and the cell will enter a state of senescence . Another example of an evolutionarily conserved survival mechanism is autophagy , which enables cells to cope with periods of starvation. If such stresses become too severe, however, the cell dies, either through a process of necrosis, which is rapid and catastrophic, or through a slower and more controlled process that is carried out by a highly regulated process of programmed cell death known as apoptosis .},

abstract = {The human brain critically relies on a continuous blood supply to ensure its function. Impaired cerebral perfusion is associated with diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease, cortical spreading depression and stroke. Cerebral cells work together to ensure a finely regulated blood supply. However, many of the underlying mechanisms of this regulation, termed neurovascular coupling (NVC), are still not fully understood. The development of mathematical models of cell signalling is a promising approach that complements experimental studies by investigating the contribution of key components and pathways and guiding further experiments. This dissertation reports the development of a lumped parameter compartment model of a neurovascular unit (NVU), comprising neurons, astrocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. The model couples neuronal activity to vasodilation/contraction models via the an astrocytic mediated perivascular K+ and the a smooth muscle Ca2+ pathway. It successfully relates a neuronal input signal to the corresponding vessel reaction. It was found that the voltage-operated Ca2+ channels are, due to the hyperpolarisation from the K+ efflux of the SMC, almost entirely closed and do not seem to play a significant role during neuronal activity. The current model shows that in contrast to a number of experiments, outlining the importance of astrocytic Ca2+ in NVC, this Ca2+ pathway is not the only one mediating NVC. Model inputs from the endothelial side of the blood vessel in form of luminal agonists provide a flux of IP3 into the EC cytosol. EC/SMC coupling through gap junctions has a substantial effect on the NVC dynamics. The IP3 influx induces Ca2+ release from the SMC stores resulting in Ca2+induced Ca2+ release oscillations which were shown to inhibit NVC. The incorporation of nitric oxide (NO) signalling pathways in the NVU model shows the vasodilating effects of NO in the resting state. Furthermore, dilation during neuronal activation is enhanced with NO dynamics included. Results show that K+ release is responsible for the fast onset of vascular response, whereas NO-modulated mechanisms maintain dilation. The govern- ing source of NO that diffuses into the SMC, which provides the contractile force, depends on neuronal activation. In the resting state the EC provides the major contribution of NO release for vasorelaxation, whereas during neuronal stimulation NO produced by the NE dominates. In a scaled model, embedded in a parallel computing environment, multiple NVUs were connected to a space filling binary tree, facilitating the simulation of a perfusing vascular tree. The model couples the NVUs to the vasculature via stretch-mediated Ca2+ channels on both the EC and SMC . The coupling between the vasculature and the set of NVUs was found to be relatively weak for the case with agonist induced where only the Ca2+ in cells inside the activated area becomes oscillatory. However, the radii of vessels both inside and outside of activated areas oscillate (albeit small for those outside). In addition, simulations reveal a different oscillation profile when comparing coupled and decoupled states with the time required to refill the cytosol with decreasing Ca2+ and increasing frequency with coupling. The solution algorithm is shown to have excellent weak and strong scaling. Results have been generated for tissue slices containing up to 4096 NVUs, which corresponds to an area of 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm of cerebral tissue.},

abstract = {Endothelial cells (ECs) lining blood vessel walls respond to shear stress, a fluid mechanical force generated by flowing blood, and the EC responses play an important role in the homeostasis of the circulatory system. Abnor- mal EC responses to shear stress impair various vascular functions and lead to vascular diseases, including hyper- tension, thrombosis, and atherosclerosis. Bioengineering approaches in which cultured ECs are subjected to shear stress in fluid-dynamically designed flow-loading devices have been widely used to analyze EC responses at the cellular and molecular levels. Remarkable progress has been made, and the results have shown that ECs alter their morphology, function, and gene expression in response to shear stress. Shear stress affects immature cells, as well as mature ECs, and promotes differentiation of bone-marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells and embryonic stem cells into ECs. Much research has been done on shear stress sensing and signal transduction, and their molecular mechanisms are gradually coming to be understood. However, much remains uncertain, and many candidates have been proposed for shear stress sensors. More extensive studies of vascular mechanobiology should increase our understanding of the molecular basis of the blood-flow-mediated control of vascular func- tions.},

The validity of the macroscopic laws of ion diffusion was critically examined within the microenvironment of the extracellular space in the rat cerebellum using ion-selective micropipettes and ionophoretic point sources. 2. The concepts of volume averaging, volume fraction (alpha) and tortuosity (lambda) were defined and shown to be theoretically appropriate for quantifying diffusion in a complex medium such as the brain. 3. Diffusion studies were made with the cations tetramethylammonium and tetraethylammonium and the anions alpha-naphthalene sulphonate and hexafluoro-arsenate, all of which remained essentially extracellular during the measurements. Diffusion parameters were measured for a period of 50s and over distances of the order of 0.1 mm. 4. Measurements of the diffusion coefficients of the ions in agar gel gave values that were very close to those derivable from the literature, thus confirming the validity of the method. 5. Measurements in the cerebellum did not reveal any systematic influences of ionophoretic current strength, electrode separation, anisotropy, inhomogeneity, charge discrimination or uptake, within the limits tested. 6. The pooled data from measurements with all the ions gave alpha = 0.21 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- S.E. of mean) and lambda = 1.55 +/- 0.05 (mean +/- S.E. of mean). 7. These results show that the extracellular space occupies about 20{\%} of the rat cerebellum and that the diffusion coefficient for small monovalent extracellular ions is reduced by a factor of 2.4 (i.e. lambda 2) without regard to charge sign. The over-all effect of this is to increase the apparent strength of any ionic source in the cerebellum by a factor of lambda 2/alpha, about 12-fold in the present case, and to modify the time course of diffusion. 8. These conclusions confirm that the laws of macroscopic diffusion are closely obeyed in the cerebellum for small ions in the extracellular space, provided that volume fraction and tortuosity are explicitly taken into account. It is likely that these conclusions are generally applicable to other brain regions and other diffusing substances. },

We will also discuss the interaction of the BBB with components of the neurovascular unit in relation to AD and the potential contribution of AD risk factors to aspects of BBB dysfunction.

abstract = {The level of [InsP3]cyt required for calcium release in A7r5 cells, a smooth muscle cell line, was determined by a new set of procedures using quantitative confocal microscopy to measure release of InsP3 from cells microinjected with caged InsP3. From these experiments, the [InsP3]cyt required to evoke a half-maximal calcium response is 100 nM. Experiments with caged glycerophosphoryl-myo-inositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (GPIP2), a slowly metabolized analogue of InsP3, gave a much slower recovery and a half-maximal response of an order of magnitude greater than InsP3. Experimental data and highly constrained variables were used to construct a mathematical model of the InsP3-dependent [Ca2+]cyt changes; the resulting simulations show high fidelity to experiment. Among the elements considered in constructing this model were the mechanism of the InsP3-receptor, InsP3 degradation, calcium buffering in the cytosol, and refilling of the ER stores via sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA) pumps. The model predicts a time constant of 0.8 s for InsP3 degradation and 13 s for GPIP2. InsP3 degradation was found to be a prerequisite for [Ca2+]cyt recovery to baseline levels and is therefore critical to the pattern of the overall [Ca2+]cyt signal. Analysis of the features of this model provides insights into the individual factors controlling the amplitude and shape of the InsP3-mediated calcium signal.},

abstract = {Recently, a universal, simple, and fail-safe mechanism has been proposed by which cerebral blood flow (CBF) might be coupled to oxygen metabolism during neuronal activation without the need for any tissue-based mechanism. According to this concept, vasodilation occurs by local erythrocytic release of nitric oxide or ATP wherever and whenever hemoglobin is deoxygenated, directly matching oxygen demand and supply in every tissue. For neurovascular coupling in the brain, we present experimental evidence challenging this view by applying an experimental regime operating without deoxy-hemoglobin. Hyperbaric hyperoxygenation (HBO) allowed us to prevent hemoglobin deoxygenation, as the oxygen that was physically dissolved in the tissue was sufficient to support oxidative metabolism. Regional CBF and regional cerebral blood oxygenation were measured using a cranial window preparation in anesthetized rats. Hemodynamic and neuronal responses to electrical forepaw stimulation or cortical spreading depression (CSD) were analyzed under normobaric normoxia and during HBO up to 4 ATA (standard atmospheres absolute). Inconsistent with the proposed mechanism, during HBO, CBF responses to functional activation or CSD were unchanged. Our results show that activation-induced CBF regulation in the brain does not operate through the release of vasoactive mediators on hemoglobin deoxygenation or through a tissue-based oxygen-sensing mechanism.},

Glial cells mediate this response via their unique anatomy, which connects neurons to arterioles. It is believed that calcium transients and the release of secondary messengers by these cells influence the vascular response. We present a model of intracellular calcium dynamics in an astrocyte (glial cell) and show that stable oscillatory behaviour is possible under certain conditions. We then couple this to a novel model for the relationship between calcium concentration and the production of vasoactive secondary messengers through a fatty-acid intermediate. The two secondary messengers modelled are epoxyeicosatrienoic and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (EET and 20-HETE, respectively). These secondary messengers are produced on different time scales, and we show how this supports the observation that the vasculature dilates rapidly in response to neural stimulation, before returning to baseline levels on a slower time scale.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is believed to be involved in a variety of central nervous system (CNS) functions, including opioid responsivity. Elucidation of the role of NO in the CNS requires the ability to elevate systematically neuronal NO concentrations in vivo. This study was conducted to assess the pharmacokinetics of L-arginine, a NO precursor, and to relate the disposition of this amino acid to the pharmacodynamic endpoint of neuronal NO production. L-Arginine (250-, 500-, or 1000-mg/kg/h) or saline was infused intravenously for 6 h to rats. L-Arginine was quantified in brain and blood (after in vivo microdialysis) with high-performance liquid chromatography. NO was quantified simultaneously with a sensitive and specific amperometric sensor placed in the hippocampus. The data were fit with a comprehensive pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model to obtain parameters governing the systemic disposition of L-arginine, the uptake of L-arginine into the brain, and subsequent NO production. Exogenous administration of L-arginine resulted in incremental elevations in hippocampal NO, with a ∼33, 48, and ∼50{\%} increase from control for the 250-, 500-, and 1000-mg/kg/h L-arginine treated rats, respectively. The PK/PD model, which incorporated known characteristics of the system (saturable uptake of L-arginine into brain; NO production governed by circadian changes in enzyme activity) was capable of describing accurately the observed data.

The ensuing pressor response could be caused by the high NO reactivity of HBOC in the vascular lumen and/or the extravasation of hemoglobin molecules. There is a need for quantitative understanding of the NO interaction with HBOC in the blood vessels. We developed a detailed mathematical model of NO diffusion and reaction in the presence of an HBOC for an arteriolar-size vessel. The HBOC reactivity with NO and degree of extravasation was studied in the range of 2-58 x 10(6) M(-1) x s(-1) and 0-100{\%}, respectively. The model predictions showed that the addition of HBOC reduced the smooth muscle (SM) NO concentration in the activation range (12-28 nM) for soluble guanylate cyclase, a major determinant of SM contraction. The SM NO concentration was significantly reduced when the extravasation of HBOC molecules was considered. The myoglobin present in the parenchymal cells scavenges NO, which reduces the SM NO concentration.},

abstract = {Experiments were carried out to investigate the functional and anatomical relationships between neuronal elements and cerebral microvessels in 300-350-$\mu$m thick coronal hippocampal slices maintained at 33-35°C, obtained from 150-200 g male Wistar rats. Cerebral arterioles (9-22 $\mu$m in diameter) were visualized in situ and pre-constricted by 22.0 ± 6.6{\%} by the addition of the thromboxane A2 agonist U46619 (75 nM), to the bathing medium. The glutamate agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate (0.01-1 mM) produced a dose-related increase in luminal diameter of pre-constricted vessels. In the presence of 4 $\mu$M haemoglobin to scavenge nitric oxide from the extravascular environment of the slice, the increase in diameter evoked by 0.1 mM N- methyl-D-aspartate was significantly reduced from 17.5 ± 4.6{\%} to 4.8 ± 1.7{\%} indicating that N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced vasodilatation of cerebral microvessels is mediated via a mechanism which involves neuronally-derived nitric oxide. In a parallel anatomical study, $\beta$-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent diaphorase staining was used to reveal the enzyme nitric oxide synthase in vascular endothelium and neurons in slices. A small subpopulation ({\textless} 11 cells per slice) of darkly-stained multipolar neurons, 21-32 $\mu$m in diameter was observed to give rise to a dense network of fine diaphorase-reactive nerve fibres that ramified throughout the whole of the hippocampus and appeared to come into close apposition with arterioles. Morphometric analysis of the relationship between cerebral microvessels, $\beta$-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced form- dependent diaphorase-reactive neuronal elements and individual pyramidal layer neurons, identified by filling with biocytin, revealed that for a given point on a pyramidal layer neuron, the proximity of the nearest diaphorase- reactive nerve fibre was less than 10 $\mu$m, whilst the distance to the nearest arteriole (the smallest functional unit for controlling blood flow) was in excess of 70 $\mu$m. Such a distance would probably preclude diffusion of vasoactive metabolites in effective concentrations from the area of increased neuronal activity. We therefore propose that the diaphorase-reactive nerve network constitutes the functional link. It is possible that during periods of increased neuronal activity, spillover of glutamate from synapses may activate the diaphorase-reactive network. Release of nitric oxide from the network in the vicinity of local cerebral arterioles may then produce relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle, enabling increased blood flow into the capillary network supplying the region of increased metabolic activity. This study has shown that the process whereby increases in neuronal activity elicit a local change in cerebral blood flow remains functionally intact in hippocampal slice preparations. Nitric oxide of neuronal origin appears to be involved in mediating the coupling between neurons and cerebral arterioles. Stereological analysis of the relationship between neuronal and vascular elements within hippocampal slices suggested that a small subpopulation of nitric oxide synthase-containing neurons which give rise to a diffuse network of fine nitric oxide synthase-containing nerve fibres that lie in close apposition to cerebral arterioles may provide the anatomical substrate for coupling of blood flow to metabolism.},

abstract = {The relationship between blood pressure (BP) and cognitive outcomes in elderly adults has implications for global health care. Both hypertension and hypotension affect brain perfusion and worsen cognitive outcomes. The presence of hypertension and other vascular risk factors has been associated with decreased performance in executive function and attention tests. Cerebrovascular reserve has emerged as a potential biomarker for monitoring pressure-perfusion-cognition relationships. A decline in vascular reserve capacity can lead to impaired neurovascular coupling and decreased cognitive ability. Endothelial dysfunction, microvascular disease, and mascrovascular disease in midlife could also have an important role in the manifestations and severity of multiple medical conditions underlying cognitive decline late in life. However, questions remain about the role of antihypertensive therapies for long-term prevention of cognitive decline. In this Review, we address the underlying pathophysiology and the existing evidence supporting the role of vascular factors in late-life cognitive decline.},

abstract = {Vascular endothelium expressing endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) produces nitric oxide (NO), which has a number of important physiological functions in the microvasculature. The rate of NO production by the endothelium is a critical determinant of NO distribution in the vascular wall. We have analyzed the biochemical pathways of NO synthesis and formulated a model to estimate NO production by the microvascular endothelium under physiological conditions. The model quantifies the NO produced by eNOS based on the kinetics of NO synthesis and the availability of eNOS and its intracellular substrates. The predicted NO production from microvessels was in the range of 0.005-0.1 microM/s. This range of predicted values is in agreement with some experimental values but is much lower than other rates previously measured or estimated from experimental data with the help of mathematical modeling. Paradoxical discrepancies between the model predictions and previously reported results based on experimental measurements of NO concentration in the vicinity of the arteriolar wall suggest that NO can also be released through eNOS-independent mechanisms, such as catalysis by neuronal NOS (nNOS). We also used our model to test the sensitivity of NO production to substrate availability, eNOS concentration, and potential rate-limiting factors. The results indicated that the predicted low level of NO production can be attributed primarily to a low expression of eNOS in the microvascular endothelial cells.},

The patients were evaluated by the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR0-CDR3) and studied in the Memory and Aging Project (MAP) of the Washington University Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADCR). With the use of immunocytochemical procedures, neurons immunoreactive to nNOS were found to show large and small multipolar and pyramidal morphologies over the entire chronic AD evolution. The iNOS and nitrotyrosine immunoreactivities were also found in pyramidal-like cortical neurons and glial cells. Here, we speculate on the interaction among all specific neurodegenerative changes in AD and nitric oxide as an additional contribution to neuronal death in AD. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Astrocytes were the original neuroglia of Ram{\'{o}}n y Cajal but after 100 years there is no satisfactory definition of what should comprise this class of cells. This essay takes a historical and philosophical approach to the question of astrocytic identity. The classic approach of identification by morphology and location are too limited to determine new members of the astrocyte population. I also critically evaluate the use of protein markers measured by immunoreactivity, as well as the newer technique of marking living cells by using promoters for these same proteins to drive reporter genes. These two latter approaches have yielded an expanded population of astrocytes with diverse functions, but also mark cells that traditionally would not be defined as astrocytes. Thus we need a combination of measures to define an astrocyte but it is not clear what this combination should be. The molecular approach, especially promoter driven fluorescent reporter genes, does have the advantage of pre marking living astrocytes for electrophysiological or imaging recordings. However, lack of sufficient understanding of the behavior of the inserted constructs has led to unclear results. This approach will no doubt be perfected with time but at present an acceptable, practical definition of what constitutes the class of astrocytes remains elusive.},

abstract = {Many cells exhibit periodic transient increases in cytosolic calcium levels rather than a sustained rise when stimulated by a hormone or growth factor. We propose here a molecular model that accounts for periodic calcium spiking induced by a constant stimulus. Four elements give rise to repetitive calcium transients: cooperativity and positive feedback between a pair of reciprocally coupled (crosscoupled) messengers, followed by deactivation and then by reactivation. The crosscoupled messengers in our model are inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and cytosolic calcium ions. The opening of calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum by the binding of multiple molecules of InsP3 provides the required cooperativity. The stimulation of receptor-activated phospholipase C by released calcium ions leads to positive feedback. InsP3 is destroyed by a phosphatase, and calcium ion is pumped back into the endoplasmic reticulum. These processes generate bistability: the cytosolic calcium concentration abruptly increases from a basal level to a stimulated level at a threshold degree of activation of phospholipase C. Spiking further requires slow deactivation and subsequent reactivation. In our model, mitochondrial sequestration of calcium ion prevents the cytosolic level from increasing above several micromolar and enables the system to return to the basal state. When the endoplasmic reticulum calcium store is refilled to a critical level by the Ca2+-ATPase pump, cooperative positive feedback between the InsP3-gated channel and phospholipase C begins again to give the next calcium spike. The time required for the calcium level in the endoplasmic reticulum to reach a threshold sets the interval between spikes. The amplitude, shape, and period of calcium spikes calculated for this model are like those observed experimentally.},

abstract = {Using interferometry-based biosensors the binding and release of endothelial and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (eNOS and nNOS) from calmodulin (CaM) was measured. In both isoforms, binding to CaM is diffusion limited and within approximately three orders of magnitude of the Smoluchowski limit imposed by orientation-independent collisions. This suggests that the orientation of CaM is facilitated by the charge arrays on the CaM-binding site and the complementary surface on CaM. Protein kinase C phosphorylation of eNOS T495, adjacent to the CaM-binding site, abolishes or greatly slows CaM binding. Kinases which increase the activity of eNOS did not stimulate the binding of CaM, which is already diffusion limited. The coupling of Ca(2+) binding and CaM/NOS binding equilibria links the affinity of CaM for NOS to the Ca(2+) dependence of CaM binding. Hence, changes in the Ca(2+) sensitivity of CaM binding always imply changes in the NOS-CaM affinity. It is possible, however, that in some regimes binding and activation are not synonymous, so that Ca(2+) sensitivity need not be tightly linked to CaM sensitivity of activation. This study is being extended using mutants to probe the roles of individual structural elements in binding and release.},

In connection with the global trend of prolonging human life and the increasing number of elderly in the population, the AD becomes one of the most serious health and socioeconomic problems of the present. Tau protein promotes assembly and stabilizes microtubules, which contributes to the proper function of neuron. Alterations in the amount or the structure of tau protein can affect its role as a stabilizer of microtubules as well as some of the processes in which it is implicated. The molecular mechanisms governing tau aggregation are mainly represented by several posttranslational modifications that alter its structure and conformational state. Hence, abnormal phosphorylation and truncation of tau protein have gained attention as key mechanisms that become tau protein in a pathological entity. Evidences about the clinicopathological significance of phosphorylated and truncated tau have been documented during the progression of AD as well as their capacity to exert cytotoxicity when expressed in cell and animal models. This paper describes the normal structure and function of tau protein and its major alterations during its pathological aggregation in AD.},

abstract = {In many cell types, asynchronous or synchronous oscillations in the concentration of intracellular free calcium occur in adjacent cells that are coupled by gap junctions. Such oscillations are believed to underlie oscillatory intercellular calcium waves in some cell types, and thus it is important to understand how they occur and are modified by intercellular coupling. Using a previous model of intracellular calcium oscillations in pancreatic acinar cells, this article explores the effects of coupling two cells with a simple linear diffusion term. Depending on the concentration of a signal molecule, inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate, coupling two identical cells by diffusion can give rise to synchronized in-phase oscillations, as well as different-amplitude in-phase oscillations and same-amplitude antiphase oscillations. Coupling two nonidentical cells leads to more complex behaviors such as cascades of period doubling and multiply periodic solutions. This study is a first step towards understanding the role and significance of the diffusion of calcium through gap junctions in the coordination of oscillatory calcium waves in a variety of cell types.

We tested whether a cGMP-dependent activation of the smooth muscle myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) resulting in a Ca2+ desensitization of the contractile apparatus was the underlying mechanism and whether it could be antagonized by the RhoA pathway.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The Ca2+ sensitivity of RA was assessed as the relation between changes in diameter and [Ca2+]i in depolarized RA (120 mol/L K+) exposed to stepwise increases in Ca2+ex (0 to 3 mmol/L). Effects of 10 micromol/L sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on Ca2+ sensitivity were determined before and after application of the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ (1 micromol/L) and the MLCP inhibitor calyculin A (120 nmol/L) and in presence of the RhoA-activating phospholipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P, 12 nmol/L). SNP-induced dilations were also studied in controls and in RAs pretreated with the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 or transfected with a dominant-negative RhoA mutant (N19RhoA). Constrictions elicited by increasing Ca2+ex were significantly attenuated by SNP, which, however, left associated increases in [Ca2+]i unaffected. This NO-induced attenuation was blocked by ODQ, calyculin A, and S1P. The S1P-induced translocation of RhoA indicating activation of the GTPase was not reversed by SNP. Inhibition of RhoA/Rho kinase by N19RhoA or Y27632 significantly augmented SNP-induced dilations.

CONCLUSIONS: NO dilates RA by activating the MLCP in a cGMP-dependent manner, thereby reducing the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus. MLCP inactivation via the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway antagonizes this Ca2+-desensitizing effect that, in turn, can be restored using RhoA/Rho kinase inhibitors.},

abstract = {Arterial pressure is a cyclic phenomenon characterized by a pressure wave oscillating around the mean blood pressure, from diastolic to systolic blood pressure, defining the pulse pressure. Aortic input impedance is a measure of the opposition of the circulation to an oscillatory flow input (stroke volume generated by heart work). Aortic input impedance integrates factors opposing LV ejection, such as peripheral resistance, viscoelastic properties and dimensions of the large central arteries, and the intensity and timing of the pressure wave reflections, associated with the opposition to LV ejection influenced by inertial forces. The two most frequently used methods of arterial stiffness are measurement of PWV and central (aortic or common carotid artery) pulse wave analysis, recorded directly at the carotid artery or indirectly in the ascending aorta from radial artery pressure curve. The arterial system is heterogenous and characterized by the existence of a stiffness gradient with progressive stiffness increase (PWV) from ascending aorta and large elastic proximal arteries to the peripheral muscular conduit arteries. Analysis of aortic or carotid pressure waveform and amplitude concerns the effect of reflected waves on pressure shape and amplitude, estimated in absolute terms, augmented pressure in millimetre of mercury, or, in relative terms, 'augmentation index' (Aix in percentage of pulse pressure). Finally, if the aortic PWV has the highest predictive value for prognosis, the aortic or central artery pressure waveform should be recorded and analysed in parallel with the measure of PWV to allow a deeper analysis of arterial haemodynamics.},

Also, traumatic brain injury, where neurons are exposed to high thrombin levels, is associated with an increased incidence of AD. Our objective was to determine the effects of thrombin administered in vivo on cognitive function and neuropathology. Rats were trained using a radial eight-arm maze and then thrombin (25 or 100 nM, 0.25 microl/h, 28 days) or vehicle was delivered via intracerebroventricular infusion. Animals that received 100 nM thrombin demonstrated cognitive impairments including deficits in reference memory and an increase in task latency. Also, significant neuropathology was detected in these animals such as enlargement of cerebral ventricles, an increased number of TUNEL-positive cells, astrogliosis, and an increase in the immunoreactivity for phosphorylated neurofilament, and apolipoprotein-E fragments. Thrombin-induced changes in cognitive function and ventricular enlargement were inhibited by hirudin. These findings demonstrate that thrombin is a mediator of neurotoxicity and cognitive deficits and suggest that inhibition of thrombin may be a treatment strategy for AD- or head trauma-associated cognitive deficits.},

Kir4.1 is the only Kir channel so far shown to be expressed in brain glial cells. We examined the distribution of Kir4.1 in rat brain with a specific antibody. The Kir4.1 immunostaining distributed broadly but not diffusely in the brain. It was strong in some regions such as the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, the Bergmann glia in the cerebellum, the ependyma, and pia mater, while little activity was detected in white matter of the corpus callosum or cerebellar peduncle. In the olfactory bulb, Kir4.1 immunoreactivity was detected in a scattered manner in about one-half of the glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes. Immunoelectron microscopic examination revealed that Kir4.1 channels were enriched on the processes of astrocytes wrapping synapses and blood vessels. These data suggest that Kir4.1 is expressed in a limited population of brain astrocytes and may play a specific role in the glial K(+)-buffering action.},

Because of their inherent nonlinear nature and the consequent unreliability of intuitive approaches, mathematical modeling has an important role to play in the study of these phenomena. One important class of oscillations and waves is dependent on the presence of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3), which releases Ca2+ from internal stores via the IP3 receptor/Ca2+ channel. With the minimum possible mathematical formalism, we review mechanistic models for IP3-dependent Ca2+ oscillations and waves. These models are based on the regulation of the IP3 receptor by both IP3 and Ca2+, and incorporate experimental data on the steady-state and kinetic properties of the receptor. The extension of the models to describe intracellular and intercellular Ca2+ waves is considered.},

abstract = {In cerebral ischemia survival of neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells is threatened during energy deprivation and/or following re-supply of oxygen and glucose. After a brief summary of characteristics of different cells types, emphasizing the dependence of all on oxidative metabolism, the bioenergetics of focal and global ischemia is discussed, distinguishing between events during energy deprivation and subsequent recovery attempt after re-circulation. Gray and white matter ischemia are described separately, and distinctions are made between mature and immature brains. Next comes a description of bioenergetics in individual cell types in culture during oxygen/glucose deprivation or exposure to metabolic inhibitors and following re-establishment of normal aerated conditions. Due to their expression of NMDA and non-NMDA receptors neurons and oligodendrocytes are exquisitely sensitive to excitotoxicity by glutamate, which reaches high extracellular concentrations in ischemic brain for several reasons, including failing astrocytic uptake. Excitotoxicity kills brain cells by energetic exhaustion (due to Na+ extrusion after channel-mediated entry) combined with mitochondrial Ca2+-mediated injury and formation of reactive oxygen species. Many (but not all) astrocytes survive energy deprivation for extended periods, but after return to aerated conditions they are vulnerable to mitochondrial damage by cytoplasmic/mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and to NAD+ deficiency. Ca2+ overload is established by reversal of Na+/Ca2+ exchangers following Na+ accumulation during Na+-K+-Cl- cotransporter stimulation or pH regulation, compensating for excessive acid production. NAD+ deficiency inhibits glycolysis and eventually oxidative metabolism, secondary to poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) activity following DNA damage. Hyperglycemia can be beneficial for neurons but increases astrocytic death due to enhanced acidosis. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The term cerebral small vessel disease refers to a group of pathological processes with various aetiologies that affect the small arteries, arterioles, venules, and capillaries of the brain. Age-related and hypertension-related small vessel diseases and cerebral amyloid angiopathy are the most common forms. The consequences of small vessel disease on the brain parenchyma are mainly lesions located in the subcortical structures such as lacunar infarcts, white matter lesions, large haemorrhages, and microbleeds. Because lacunar infarcts and white matter lesions are easily detected by neuroimaging, whereas small vessels are not, the term small vessel disease is frequently used to describe the parenchyma lesions rather than the underlying small vessel alterations. This classification, however, restricts the definition of small vessel disease to ischaemic lesions and might be misleading. Small vessel disease has an important role in cerebrovascular disease and is a leading cause of cognitive decline and functional loss in the elderly. Small vessel disease should be a main target for preventive and treatment strategies, but all types of presentation and complications should be taken into account. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Karch2000,
abstract = {There is a marked difference in the structure of the arterial tree between epi- and endocardial layers of the human heart. To model these structural variations, we developed an extension to the computational method of constrained constructive optimization (CCO). Within the framework of CCO, a model tree is represented as a dichotomously branching network of straight cylindrical tubes, with flow conditions governed by Poiseuille's law. The tree is grown by successively adding new terminal segments from randomly selected points within the perfusion volume while optimizing the geometric location and topological site of each new connection with respect to minimum intravascular volume. The proposed method of "staged growth" guides the generation of new terminal sites by means of an additional time-dependent boundary condition, thereby inducing a sequence of domains of vascular growth within the given perfusion volume. Model trees generated in this way are very similar to reality in their visual appearance and predict diameter ratios of parent and daughter segments, the distribution of symmetry, the transmural distribution of flow, the volume of large arteries, as well as the ratio of small arterial volume in subendocardial and subepicardial layers in good agreement with experimental data. From this study we conclude that the method of CCO combined with staged growth reproduces many characteristics of the different arterial branching patterns in the subendocardium and the subepicardium, which could not be obtained by applying the principle of minimum volume alone.},

It was found that purified recombinant nNOS was phosphorylated by CaM-K Ialpha, CaM-K IIalpha, and CaM-K IV at Ser847 in vitro. Replacement of Ser847 with Ala (S847A) prevented phosphorylation by CaM kinases. Phosphorylated recombinant wild-type nNOS at Ser847 (approximately 0.5 mol of phosphate incorporation into nNOS) exhibited a 30{\%} decrease of Vmax with little change of both the Km for L-arginine and Kact for CaM relative to unphosphorylated enzyme. The activity of mutant S847D was decreased to a level 50-60{\%} as much as the wild-type enzyme. The decreased NOS enzyme activity of phosphorylated nNOS at Ser847 and mutant S847D was partially due to suppression of CaM binding, but not to impairment of dimer formation which is thought to be essential for enzyme activation. Inactive nNOS lacking CaM-binding ability was generated by mutation of Lys732-Lys-Leu to Asp732-Asp-Glu (Watanabe, Y., Hu, Y., and Hidaka, H. (1997) FEBS Lett. 403, 75-78). It was phosphorylated by CaM kinases, as was the wild-type enzyme, indicating that CaM-nNOS binding was not required for the phosphorylation reaction. We developed antibody NP847, which specifically recognize nNOS in its phosphorylated state at Ser847. Using the antibody NP847, we obtained evidence that nNOS is phosphorylated at Ser847 in rat brain. Thus, our results suggest that CaM kinase-induced phosphorylation of nNOS at Ser847 alters the activity control of this enzyme.},

abstract = {We have used Monte Carlo simulations to understand the generation of quantal responses at the single active zones of CA1 synapses. We constructed a model of AMPA channel activation that accounts for the responses to controlled glutamate application and a model of glutamate diffusion in the synaptic cleft. With no further adjustments to these models, we simulated the response to the release of glutamate from a single vesicle. The predicted response closely matches the rise time of observed responses, which recent measurements show is much faster ({\textless}100 micros) than previously thought. The simulations show that initial channel opening is driven by a brief ({\textless}100 micros) glutamate spike near the site of vesicle fusion, producing a hotspot of channel activation (diameter: approximately 250 nm) smaller than many synapses. Quantal size therefore depends more strongly on the density of channels than their number, a finding that has important implications for measuring synaptic strength. Recent measurements allow estimation of AMPA receptor density at CA1 synapses. Using this value, our simulations correctly predicts a quantal amplitude of approximately 10 pA. We have also analyzed the properties of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) generated by the multivesicular release that can occur during evoked responses. We find that summation is nearly linear and that the existence of multiple narrow peaks in amplitude histograms can be accounted for. It has been unclear how to reconcile the existence of these narrow peaks, which indicate that the variation of quantal amplitude is small (CV {\textless} 0.2) with the highly variable amplitude of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs; CV approximately 0.6). According to one theory, mEPSC variability arises from variation in vesicle glutamate content. However, both our modeling results and recent experimental results indicate that this view cannot account for the observed rise time/amplitude correlation of mEPSCs. In contrast, this correlation and the high mEPSC variability can be accounted for if some mEPSCs are generated by two or more vesicles released with small temporal jitter. We conclude that a broad range of results can be accounted for by simple principles: quantal amplitude (approximately 10 pA) is stereotyped, some mEPSCs are multivesicular at moderate and large synapses, and evoked responses are generated by quasi-linear summation of multiple quanta.},

The effects of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) on the function of cerebral blood vessels were analyzed applying cerebral blood volume (CBV)-based fMRI to transgenic arcA beta mice. In a cortical brain region of interest (ROI), displaying high CAA, arcA beta mice older than 16 months showed reduced response to the vasodilatory substance acetazolamide compared to age-matched wild-type animals, both with regard to rate (vascular reactivity) and extent of vasodilation (maximal vasodilation). In a subcortical ROI, displaying little CAA, no genotype-specific decrease was observed, but maximal vasodilation decreased with age in arcA beta and wild-types. These findings indicate that vascular beta-amyloid deposits reduce the capacity of cerebral blood vessels to dilate upon demand, supporting the hypothesis that vascular beta-amyloid contributes to hypoperfusion and neurological deficits observed in AD and CAA. High diagnostic accuracy of the combined readouts in detecting vascular dysfunction in arcA beta mice was found.},

abstract = {Calcium signaling is studied as a potential form of astrocyte excitability that may control astrocyte involvement in synaptic and cerebrovascular regulation. Fundamental questions remain unanswered about astrocyte calcium signaling, as current methods can not resolve calcium in small volume compartments, such as near the cell membrane and in distal cell processes. We modified the genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP2 with a membrane-tethering domain, Lck, increasing the level of Lck-GCaMP2 near the plasma membrane tenfold as compared with conventional GCaMP2. Using Lck-GCaMP2 in rat hippocampal astrocyte-neuron cocultures, we measured near-membrane calcium signals that were evoked pharmacologically or by single action potential-mediated neurotransmitter release. Moreover, we identified highly localized and frequent spontaneous calcium signals in astrocyte somata and processes that conventional GCaMP2 failed to detect. Lck-GCaMP2 acts as a genetically targeted calcium sensor for monitoring calcium signals in previously inaccessible parts of astrocytes, including fine processes.},

abstract = {Cerebral autoregulation (CA) is an most important mechanism responsible for the relatively constant blood flow supply to brain when cerebral perfusion pressure varies. Its assessment in nonacute cases has been relied on the quantification of the relationship between noninvasive beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) and blood flow velocity (BFV). To overcome the nonstationary nature of physiological signals such as BP and BFV, a computational method called multimodal pressure-flow (MMPF) analysis was recently developed to study the nonlinear BP-BFV relationship during the Valsalva maneuver (VM). The present study aimed to determine (i) whether this method can estimate autoregulation from spontaneous BP and BFV fluctuations during baseline rest conditions; (ii) whether there is any difference between the MMPF measures of autoregulation based on intra-arterial BP (ABP) and based on cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP); and (iii) whether the MMPF method provides reproducible and reliable measure for noninvasive assessment of autoregulation. To achieve these aims, we analyzed data from existing databases including: (i) ABP and BFV of 12 healthy control, 10 hypertensive, and 10 stroke subjects during baseline resting conditions and during the Valsalva maneuver, and (ii) ABP, CPP, and BFV of 30 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who were being paralyzed, sedated, and ventilated. We showed that autoregulation in healthy control subjects can be characterized by specific phase shifts between BP and BFV oscillations during the Valsalva maneuver, and the BP-BFV phase shifts were reduced in hypertensive and stroke subjects (P {\textless} 0.01), indicating impaired autoregulation. Similar results were found during baseline condition from spontaneous BP and BFV oscillations. The BP-BFV phase shifts obtained during baseline and during VM were highly correlated (R {\textgreater} 0.8, P {\textless} 0.0001), showing no statistical difference (paired-t test P {\textgreater} 0.47). In TBI patients there were strong correlations between phases of ABP and CPP oscillations (R = 0.99, P {\textless} 0.0001) and, thus, between ABP-BFV and CPP-BFV phase shifts (P {\textless} 0.0001, R = 0.76). By repeating the MMPF 4 times on data of TBI subjects, each time on a selected cycle of spontaneous BP and BFV oscillations, we showed that MMPF had better reproducibility than traditional autoregulation index. These results indicate that the MMPF method, based on instantaneous phase relationships between cerebral blood flow velocity and peripheral blood pressure, has better performance than the traditional standard method, and can reliably assess cerebral autoregulation dynamics from ambulatory blood pressure and cerebral blood flow during supine rest conditions.},

Cells at three key interfaces form barriers between the blood and the CNS: the blood-brain barrier (BBB), blood-CSF barrier and the arachnoid barrier. The BBB at the level of brain microvessel endothelium is the major site of blood-CNS exchange. The structure and function of the BBB is summarised, the physical barrier formed by the endothelial tight junctions, and the transport barrier resulting from membrane transporters and vesicular mechanisms. The roles of associated cells are outlined, especially the endfeet of astrocytic glial cells, and pericytes and microglia. The embryonic development of the BBB, and changes in pathology are described. The BBB is subject to short and long-term regulation, which may be disturbed in pathology. Any programme for drug discovery or delivery, to target or avoid the CNS, needs to consider the special features of the BBB.},

@article{Hyder2006,
abstract = {Prior 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) experiments, which simultaneously measured in vivo rates of total glutamate-glutamine cycling (V(cyc(tot))) and neuronal glucose oxidation (CMR(glc(ox), N)), revealed a linear relationship between these fluxes above isoelectricity, with a slope of approximately 1. In vitro glial culture studies examining glutamate uptake indicated that glutamate, which is cotransported with Na+, stimulated glial uptake of glucose and release of lactate. These in vivo and in vitro results were consolidated into a model: recycling of one molecule of neurotransmitter between glia and neurons was associated with oxidation of one glucose molecule in neurons; however, the glucose was taken up only by glia and all the lactate (pyruvate) generated by glial glycolysis was transferred to neurons for oxidation. The model was consistent with the 1:1 relationship between DeltaCMR(glc(ox), N) and DeltaV(cyc(tot)) measured by 13C MRS. However, the model could not specify the energetics of glia and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) neurons because quantitative values for these pathways were not available. Here, we review recent 13C and 14C tracer studies that enable us to include these fluxes in a more comprehensive model. The revised model shows that glia produce at least 8{\%} of total oxidative ATP and GABAergic neurons generate approximately 18{\%} of total oxidative ATP in neurons. Neurons produce at least 88{\%} of total oxidative ATP, and take up approximately 26{\%} of the total glucose oxidized. Glial lactate (pyruvate) still makes the major contribution to neuronal oxidation, but approximately 30{\%} less than predicted by the prior model. The relationship observed between DeltaCMR(glc(ox), N) and DeltaV(cyc(tot)) is determined by glial glycolytic ATP as before. Quantitative aspects of the model, which can be tested by experimentation, are discussed.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is an important vasodilator with various activities in the cerebral vasculature. Although the response of NO levels to shear stress has been investigated in various models using systemic endothelium, no study has evaluated human cerebral endothelial cells (HCE). We determined the NO levels of HCE cultured in an artificial capillary system in response to changes in shear stress. With direct measurement by a porphyrinic microsensor, we found that NO levels increased immediately with a peak at 7 h after changes in shear stress, and by 24 h dropped to a constant elevated baseline. Shear stress-mediated increases in NO levels were confirmed by the measurement of citrulline, an indirect measure of NO. Furthermore, NO levels by HCE were shown to decrease with decreasing shear stress levels. This study presents a novel system to study NO production by microvascular HCE, and indicates a linear relationship between shear stress and NO levels. As cerebral vessels age and lose transmural compliance, shear stress-mediated production of NO may play a greater role in cerebrovascular function and dysfunction.},

abstract = {Control of cerebral vasculature differs from that of systemic vessels outside the blood-brain barrier. The hypothesis that the endothelium modulates vasomotion via direct myoendothelial coupling was investigated in a small vessel of the cerebral circulation. In the primary branch of the rat basilar artery, membrane potential, diameter, and calcium dynamics associated with vasomotion were examined using selective inhibitors of endothelial function in intact and endothelium-denuded arteries. Vessel anatomy, protein, and mRNA expression were studied using conventional electron microscopy high-resolution ultrastructural and confocal immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR. Membrane potential oscillations were present in both endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and these preceded rhythmical contractions during which adjacent SMC intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) waves were synchronized. Endothelium removal abolished vasomotion and desynchronized adjacent smooth muscle cell [Ca(2+)](i) waves. N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (10 microM) did not mimic this effect, and dibutyryl cGMP (300 muM) failed to resynchronize [Ca(2+)](i) waves in endothelium-denuded arteries. Combined charybdotoxin and apamin abolished vasomotion and depolarized and constricted vessels, even in absence of endothelium. Separately, (37,43)Gap27 and (40)Gap27 abolished vasomotion. Extensive myoendothelial gap junctions (3 per endothelial cell) composed of connexins 37 and 40 connected the endothelial cell and SMC layers. Synchronized vasomotion in rat basilar artery is endothelium dependent, with [Ca(2+)](i) waves generated within SMCs being coordinated by electrical coupling via myoendothelial gap junctions.},

Although the electrophysiological properties of P2X2 receptors have been extensively studied, little is known about the plasma membrane lateral mobility of P2X2 receptors or whether receptor mobility is regulated by ATP. Here we used single-molecule imaging with simultaneous whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings to track quantum dot-labeled P2X2 receptors in the dendrites of rat hippocampal neurons to explore P2X2 receptor mobility and its regulation. We find that plasma membrane P2X2 receptor lateral mobility in dendrites is heterogeneous but mostly Brownian in nature, consisting of mobile and slowly mobile receptor pools. Moreover, lateral mobility is P2X2 subunit and cell specific, is increased in an activation-dependent manner, and is regulated by cytosolic VILIP1, a calcium binding protein. Our data provide the first direct measures of P2X receptor mobility and show that P2X2 receptors are mobile ATP sensors, sampling more of the dendritic plasma membrane in response to ATP.},

abstract = {Vascular cells communicate electrically to coordinate their activity and control tissue blood flow. To foster a quantitative understanding of this fundamental process, we developed a computational model that was structured to mimic a skeletal muscle resistance artery. Each endothelial cell and smooth muscle cell in our virtual artery was treated as the electrical equivalent of a capacitor coupled in parallel with a non-linear resistor representing ionic conductance; intercellular gap junctions were represented by ohmic resistors. Simulations revealed that the vessel wall is not a syncytium in which electrical stimuli spread equally to all constitutive cells. Indeed, electrical signals spread in a differential manner among and between endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells according to the initial stimulus. The predictions of our model agree with physiological data from the feed artery of the hamster retractor muscle. Cell orientation and coupling resistance were the principal factors that enable electrical signals to spread differentially along and between the two cell types. Our computational observations also illustrated how gap junctional coupling enables the vessel wall to filter and transform transient electrical events into sustained voltage responses. Functionally, differential electrical communication would permit discrete regions of smooth muscle activity to locally regulate blood flow and the endothelium to coordinate regional changes in tissue perfusion.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in a large number of cellular processes and dysfunctions in NO production have been implicated in many different disease states. In the vasculature NO is released by endothelial cells where it modulates the underlying smooth muscle to regulate vascular tone. Due to the unique chemistry of NO, such as its reactive and free radical nature, it can interact with many different cellular constituents such as thiols and transition metal ions, which determine its cellular actions. In this review we also discuss many of the useful pharmacological tools that have been developed and used extensively to establish the involvement of NO in endothelium-derived relaxations. In addition, the recent literature identifying a potential source of NO in endothelial cells, which is not directly derived from endothelial nitric oxide synthase is examined. Finally, the photorelaxation phenomena, which mediates the release of NO from a vascular smooth muscle NO store, is discussed.},

abstract = {Evidence is fast accumulating which indicates that Alzheimer's disease is a vascular disorder with neurodegenerative consequences rather than a neurodegenerative disorder with vascular consequences. It is proposed that two factors need to be present for AD to develop: (1) advanced ageing, (2) presence of a condition that lowers cerebral perfusion, such as a vascular-risk factor. The first factor introduces a normal but potentially insidious process that lowers cerebral blood flow in inverse relation to increased ageing; the second factor adds a crucial burden which further lowers brain perfusion and places vulnerable neurons in a state of high energy compromise leading to a cascade of neuronal metabolic turmoil. Convergence of the two factors above will culminate in a critically attained threshold of cerebral hypoperfusion (CATCH). CATCH is a hemodynamic microcirculatory insufficiency that will destabilize neurons, synapses, neurotransmission and cognitive function, creating in its wake a neurodegenerative state characterized by the formation of senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid angiopathy and in some cases, Lewy bodies. Since any of a considerable number of vascular-related conditions must be present in the ageing individual for cognition to be disturbed, CATCH identifies an important aspect of the heterogeneic disease profile assumed to be present in the AD syndrome. It is proposed that CATCH initiates AD by distorting regional brain capillary structure involving endothelial cell shape changes and impairment of nitric oxide (NO) release which affect signaling between the immune, cardiovascular and nervous systems. Evidence is presented that in many tissues there is a basal level of NO being produced and that the actions of several signaling molecules may initiate increases in basal NO levels. Moreover, these temporary increases in basal NO levels exert inhibitory cellular actions, via cellular conformational changes. Findings indicate that (a) constitutive NO is responsible for a basal or 'tonal' level of NO; (b) this NO keeps particular types of cells in a state of inhibition and (c) activation of these cells occurs through disinhibition. Consequently, tissues not maintaining a basal NO level are more prone to excitatory, immune, vascular and neural influences. Under such circumstances, these tissues cannot be down-regulated to normal basal levels, thus prolonging their excitatory state. Thus, the clinical convergence of advanced ageing in the presence of a chronic, pre-morbid vascular risk factor, can, in time, contribute to an endotheliopathy involving basal NO deficit, to the degree where regional metabolic dysfunction leads to cognitive meltdown and to progressive neurodegeneration characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with a cascade of pathological events involving formation of amyloid-based neuritic plaques and tau-based neurofibrillary tangles, changes in brain structure and function, and eventually, cognitive impairment and functional disability. The precise sequence of when each of these disease markers becomes abnormal is not yet clearly understood. The present study systematically tested the relationship between classes of biomarkers according to a proposed model of temporal sequence by Jack et al. (Lancet Neurology 9:119-128, 2010). We examined temporal relations among four classes of biomarkers: CSF A{\$}\beta{\$}, CSF tau, neuroimaging variables (hippocampal volume, ventricular volume, FDG PET), and cognitive variables (memory and executive function). Random effects modeling of longitudinal data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was used to test hypotheses that putative earlier markers of AD predicted change in later markers, and that intervening markers reduced effects of earlier on later markers. Specifically, we hypothesized that CSF tau would explain CSF A{\$}\beta{\$}'s relation to neuroimaging and cognitive variables, and neuroimaging variables would explain tau's relation to cognitive variables. Consistent with hypotheses, results indicated that CSF A{\$}\beta{\$} effects on cognition change were substantially attenuated by CSF tau and measures of brain structure and function, and CSF tau effects on cognitive change were attenuated by neuroimaging variables. Contrary to hypotheses, CSF A{\$}\beta{\$} and CSF tau were observed to have independent effects on neuroimaging and CSF tau had a direct effect on baseline cognition independent of brain structure and function. These results have implications for clarifying the temporal sequence of AD changes and corresponding biomarkers.},

abstract = {1. Whole cell and cell-attached patch-clamp recordings were obtained from rat spinal cord astrocytes maintained in culture for 6-14 days. It was found that the resting conductance in these astrocytes is primarily due to inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) channels. 2. Two types of astrocytic Kir channels were identified with single-channel conductances of approximately 28 and approximately 80 pS, respectively. Channels displayed some voltage dependence in their open probability, which was largest (0.8-0.9) near the K+ equilibrium potential (Ek) and decreased at more negative potentials. The resting potential closely followed Ek, so it can be assumed that Kir channels have a high open probability at the resting potential. 3. The conductance of inwardly rectifying K+ currents (Kir) depended strongly on [K+]o and was approximately proportional to the square-root of [K+]o. 4. Kir currents inactivated in a time- and voltage-dependent manner. The Na+ dependence of inactivation was studied with ion substitution experiments. Replacement of [Na+]o with choline or Li+ removed inactivation. This dependence of current inactivation on [Na+]o resembles the previously described block of Kir channels in other systems by [Na+]o. 5. Kir currents were also blocked in a dose-dependent manner by Cs+ (Kd = 189 microM at -140 mV), Ba2+ (Kd = 3.5 microM), and tetraethylammonium (TEA; 90{\%} block at 10 mM) but were insensitive to 4-aminopyridine (4-AP; 5 mM). In the current-clamp mode, Ba2+ and TEA inhibition of Kir currents was associated with a marked depolarization, suggesting that Kir channel activity played a role in the establishment of the negative resting potential typical of astrocytes. 6. These biophysical features of astrocyte inwardly rectifying K+ channels are consistent with those properties required for their proposed involvement in [K+]o clearance: 1) high open probability at the resting potential, 2) increasing conductance with increasing [K+]o, and 3) rectification, e.g., channel closure, at positive potentials. It is proposed, therefore, that the dissipation of [K+]o following neuronal activity is mediated primarily by the activity of astrocytic Kir channels.},

abstract = {Nearly 400 years ago, Thomas Willis described the arterial ring at the base of the brain (the circle of Willis, CW) and recognized it as a compensatory system in the case of arterial occlusion. This theory is still accepted. We present several arguments that via negativa should discard the compensatory theory. (1) Current theory is anthropocentric; it ignores other species and their analog structures. (2) Arterial pathologies are diseases of old age, appearing after gene propagation. (3) According to the current theory, evolution has foresight. (4) Its commonness among animals indicates that it is probably a convergent evolutionary structure. (5) It was observed that communicating arteries are too small for effective blood flow, and (6) missing or hypoplastic in the majority of the population. We infer that CW, under physiologic conditions, serves as a passive pressure dissipating system; without considerable blood flow, pressure is transferred from the high to low pressure end, the latter being another arterial component of CW. Pressure gradient exists because pulse wave and blood flow arrive into the skull through different cerebral arteries asynchronously, due to arterial tree asymmetry. Therefore, CW and its communicating arteries protect cerebral artery and blood-brain barrier from hemodynamic stress.},

abstract = {beta-Amyloid protein (A beta) is the major component of the senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and microglial cells have been shown to be closely associated with these plaques. However, the roles of A beta and microglial cells in pathogenesis of AD remain unclear. Incubation of rat microglial cells with A beta(1-40) caused a significant increase in nitrite, a stable metabolite of nitric oxide (NO), in culture media, while there was no detectable increase in nitrite in astrocyte-rich glial cells or cortical neurons after incubation with A beta(1-40). Nitrite production by microglial cells was also induced by A beta(1-42), but not A beta(25-35). An inhibitor of NO synthase, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA), as well as dexamethasone and actinomycin D, dose-dependently inhibited this nitrite production. Among the various cytokines investigated such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), only IFN-gamma markedly enhanced A beta-dependent nitrite production. Cultured cortical neurons were injured by microglial cells stimulated with A beta in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of IFN-gamma. Neurotoxicity caused by the A beta plus IFN-gamma-stimulated microglial cells was significantly attenuated by NMMA. Thus, although further investigations into the effect of A beta on human microglial cells are needed, it is likely that A beta-induced NO production by microglial cells is one mechanism of the neuronal death in AD.},

abstract = {The most fundamental aspect of the cerebral circulation is the well-described coupling of cerebral metabolic activity and cerebral blood flow. A number of substances have been proposed to link flow and metabolism, including K+, pH and adenosine. In the ??-chloralose anaesthetised cat we studied simultaneuously cerebral neuronal activity and local blood flow to attempt to dissociate the two and thus determine the coupling substance. Neuronal activity was determined by monitoring unit firing in the parietal cortex with tungsten in glass microelectrodes while local cerebral blood flow in the same area was monitored continuously using laser Doppler flowmetry. To initiate an increase in metabolic activity and, pari passu, blood flow spreading depression was elicited by needle stick injury. Spreading depression when initiated causes a wave of depolarization, measured as an increased firing rate and associated marked (400??95{\%}) increase in local cerebral blood flow. Intravenous administration of NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), a potent nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, produced a complete blockade of the hyperemia associated with spreading depression but no change in either resting cell firing or spreading depression-evoked increases in firing rate. These data demonstrate at least for spreading depression-elicited increases in metabolic activity, that nitric oxide (NO) is a key coupling compound that links changes in cerebral blood flow and metabolism. These data imply that NO may have a more general role in flow/metabolism coupling and further studies in other situations are required to determine the extent to which NO is responsible for this fundamental cerebrovascular phenomenon. ?? 1992.},

The technique 1) employs a parallel tube model of the arterial tree to establish a transfer function relating PAP to AP with unknown parameters; 2) estimates the parameters from the measured PAP waveform, along with a single non-invasive measurement of the wave transmission delay from the aorta to the peripheral artery measurement site, by exploiting the fact that aortic flow is zero during diastole; and 3) applies the transfer function to the PAP waveform to predict the unmeasured AP waveform. In this way, in contrast to the conventional generalized transfer function paradigm, the transfer function is able to adapt to the inter-subject and temporal variability of the arterial tree. We applied this adaptive transfer function technique to PAP waveforms measured from five dogs instrumented with reference AP catheters during various hemodynamic interventions. Our results showed that the technique was able to reliably estimate the AP waveform with an overall error of 4.2 mmHg. For comparison, the corresponding errors of two previously proposed generalized transfer functions trained on a subset of the same canine data were, on average, 19{\%} larger.},

abstract = {It is well known that atherosclerosis occurs at very specific locations throughout the human vasculature, such as arterial bifurcations and bends, all of which are subjected to low wall shear stress. A key player in the pathology of atherosclerosis is the endothelium, controlling the passage of material to and from the artery wall. Endothelial dysfunction refers to the condition where the normal regulation of processes by the endothelium is diminished. In this paper, the blood flow and transport of the low diffusion coefficient species adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are investigated in a variety of arterial geometries: a bifurcation with varying inner angle, and an artery bend. A mathematical model of endothelial calcium and endothelial nitric oxide synthase cellular dynamics is used to investigate spatial variations in the physiology of the endothelium. This model allows assessment of regions of the artery wall deficient in nitric oxide (NO). The models here aim to determine whether 3D flow fields are important in determining ATP concentration and endothelial function. For ATP transport, the effects of a coronary and carotid wave form on mass transport is investigated for low Womersley number. For the carotid, the Womersley number is then increased to determine whether this is an important factor. The results show that regions of low wall shear stress correspond with regions of impaired endothetial nitric oxide synthase signaling, therefore reduced availability of NO. However, experimental work is required to determine if this level is significant. The results also suggest that bifurcation angle is an important factor and acute angle bifurcations are more susceptible to disease than large angle bifurcations. It has been evidenced that complex 3D flow fields play an important role in determining signaling within endothelial cells. Furthermore, the distribution of ATP in blood is highly dependent on secondary flow features. The models here use ATP concentration simulated under steady conditions. This has been evidenced to reproduce essential features of time-averaged ATP concentration over a cardiac cycle for small Womersley numbers. However, when the Womersley number is increased, some differences are observed. Transient variations are overall insignificant, suggesting that spatial variation is more important than temporal. It has been determined that acute angle bifurcations are potentially more susceptible to atherogenesis and steady-state ATP transport reproduces essential features of time-averaged pulsatile transport for small Womersley number. Larger Womersley numbers appear to be an important factor in time-dependent mass transfer.},

abstract = {Cognitive impairment and emotional disturbances in Alzheimer's disease (AD) result from the degeneration of synapses and death of neurons in the limbic system and associated regions of the cerebral cortex. An alteration in the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) results in increased production and accumulation of amyloid ??-peptide (A??) in the brain. A?? has been shown to cause synaptic dysfunction and can render neurons vulnerable to excitotoxicity and apoptosis by a mechanism involving disruption of cellular calcium homeostasis. By inducing membrane lipid peroxidation and generation of the aldehyde 4-hydroxynonenal, A?? impairs the function of membrane ion-motive ATPases and glucose and glutamate transporters, and can enhance calcium influx through voltage-dependent and ligand-gated calcium channels. Reduced levels of a secreted form of APP which normally regulates synaptic plasticity and cell survival may also promote disruption of synaptic calcium homeostasis in AD. Some cases of inherited AD are caused by mutations in presenilins 1 and 2 which perturb endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium homeostasis such that greater amounts of calcium are released upon stimulation, possibly as the result of alterations in IP3 and ryanodine receptor channels, Ca2+-ATPases and the ER stress protein Herp. Abnormalities in calcium regulation in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia have also been documented in studies of experimental models of AD, suggesting contributions of these alterations to neuronal dysfunction and cell death in AD. Collectively, the available data show that perturbed cellular calcium homeostasis plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of AD, suggesting potential benefits of preventative and therapeutic strategies that stabilize cellular calcium homeostasis. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A major receptor for nitric oxide (NO) is the cGMP-synthesizing enzyme, soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), but it is not known how this enzyme behaves in cells. In cerebellar cells, NO (from diethylamine NONOate) increased astrocytic cGMP with a potency (EC(50) {\textless}/= 20 nM) higher than that reported for purified sGC. Deactivation of NO-stimulated sGC activity, studied by trapping free NO with hemoglobin, took place within seconds (or less) rather than the minute time scale reported for the purified enzyme. Measurement of the rates of accumulation and degradation of cGMP were used to follow the activity of sGC over time. The peak activity, occurring within seconds of adding NO, was swiftly followed by desensitization to a steady-state level 8-fold lower. The same desensitizing profile was observed when the net sGC activity was increased or decreased or when cGMP breakdown was inhibited. Recovery from desensitization was relatively slow (half-time = 1.5 min). When the cells were lysed, sGC desensitization was lost. Analysis of the transient cGMP response to NO in human platelets showed that sGC underwent a similar desensitization. The results indicate that, in its natural environment, sGC behaves much more like a neurotransmitter receptor than had been expected from previous enzymological studies, and that hitherto unknown sGC regulatory factors exist. Rapid sGC desensitization, in concert with variations in the rate of cGMP breakdown, provides a fundamental mechanism for shaping cellular cGMP responses and is likely to be important in decoding NO signals under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO), the smallest signalling molecule known, is produced by three isoforms of NO synthase (NOS; EC 1.14.13.39). They all utilize l-arginine and molecular oxygen as substrates and require the cofactors reduced nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and (6R-)5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)). All NOS bind calmodulin and contain haem. Neuronal NOS (nNOS, NOS I) is constitutively expressed in central and peripheral neurons and some other cell types. Its functions include synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS), central regulation of blood pressure, smooth muscle relaxation, and vasodilatation via peripheral nitrergic nerves. Nitrergic nerves are of particular importance in the relaxation of corpus cavernosum and penile erection. Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil) require at least a residual nNOS activity for their action. Inducible NOS (NOS II) can be expressed in many cell types in response to lipopolysaccharide, cytokines, or other agents. Inducible NOS generates large amounts of NO that have cytostatic effects on parasitic target cells. Inducible NOS contributes to the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases and septic shock. Endothelial NOS (eNOS, NOS III) is mostly expressed in endothelial cells. It keeps blood vessels dilated, controls blood pressure, and has numerous other vasoprotective and anti-atherosclerotic effects. Many cardiovascular risk factors lead to oxidative stress, eNOS uncoupling, and endothelial dysfunction in the vasculature. Pharmacologically, vascular oxidative stress can be reduced and eNOS functionality restored with renin- and angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors, with angiotensin receptor blockers, and with statins.},

Here, we provide such a theoretical derivation for the volume-diameter and flow-length scaling laws of intraspecific vascular trees. In conjunction with the minimum energy hypothesis, this formulation also results in diameter-length, flow-diameter and flow-volume scaling laws. The intraspecific scaling predicts the volume-diameter power relation with a theoretical exponent of 3, which is validated by the experimental measurements for the three major coronary arterial trees in swine (where a least-squares fit of these measurements has exponents of 2.96, 3 and 2.98 for the left anterior descending artery, left circumflex artery and right coronary artery trees, respectively). This scaling law as well as others agrees very well with the measured morphometric data of vascular trees in various other organs and species. This study is fundamental to the understanding of morphological and haemodynamic features in a biological vascular tree and has implications for vascular disease.},

abstract = {Brain edema and associated increased intracranial pressure are major consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI). An important early component of the edema associated with TBI is astrocyte swelling (cytotoxic edema). Mechanisms for such swelling, however, are poorly understood. Ion channels/transporters/exchangers play a major role in cell volume regulation, and a disturbance in one or more of these systems may result in cell swelling. To examine potential mechanisms in TBI-mediated brain edema, we employed a fluid percussion model of in vitro barotrauma and examined the role of the ion transporter Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-)-cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) in trauma-induced astrocyte swelling as this transporter has been strongly implicated in the mechanism of cell swelling in various neurological conditions. Cultures exposed to trauma (3, 4, 5 atm pressure) caused a significant increase in NKCC1 activity (21{\%}, 42{\%}, 110{\%}, respectively) at 3 h. At 5 atm pressure, trauma significantly increased NKCC1 activity at 1 h and it remained increased for up to 3 h. Trauma also increased the phosphorylation (activation) of NKCC1 at 1 and 3 h. Inhibition of MAPKs and oxidative/nitrosative stress diminished the trauma-induced NKCC1 phosphorylation as well as its activity. Bumetanide, an inhibitor of NKCC1, significantly reduced the trauma-induced astrocyte swelling (61{\%}). Silencing NKCC1 with siRNA led to a reduction in trauma-induced NKCC1 activity as well as in cell swelling. These findings demonstrate the critical involvement of NKCC1 in the astrocyte swelling following in vitro trauma, and suggest that blocking NKCC1 activity may represent a useful therapeutic strategy for the cytotoxic brain edema associated with the early phase of TBI.},

abstract = {The inwardly rectifying K+ channel subunit Kir5.1 is expressed abundantly in the brain, but its precise distribution and function are still largely unknown. Because Kir5.1 is co-expressed with Kir4.1 in retinal glial Muller cells, we have compared the biochemical and immunological properties of Kir5.1 and Kir4.1 in the mouse brain. Immunoprecipitation experiments suggested that brain expressed at least two subsets of Kir channels, heteromeric Kir4.1/5.1 and homomeric Kir4.1. Immunolabeling using specific antibodies showed that channels comprising Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 subunits were assembled in a region-specific fashion. Heteromeric Kir4.1/5.1 was identified in the neocortex and in the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb. Homomeric Kir4.1 was confined to the hippocampus and the thalamus. Homomeric Kir5.1 was not identified. Kir4.1/5.1 and Kir4.1 expression appeared to occur only in astrocytes, specifically in the membrane domains facing the pia mater and blood vessels or in the processes surrounding synapses. Both Kir4.1/5.1 and Kir4.1 could be associated with PDZ domain-containing syntrophins, which might be involved in the subcellular targeting of these astrocyte Kir channels. Because heteromeric Kir4.1/5.1 and homomeric Kir4.1 have distinct ion channel properties (Tanemoto, M., Kittaka, N., Inanobe, A., and Kurachi, Y. (2000) J. Physiol.

abstract = {The ER is a central element in Ca(2+) signaling, both as a modulator of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and as a locus of Ca(2+)-regulated events. During surface membrane depolarization in excitable cells, the ER may either accumulate or release net Ca(2+), but the conditions of stimulation that determine which form of net Ca(2+) transport occurs are not well understood. The direction of net ER Ca(2+) transport depends on the relative rates of Ca(2+) uptake and release via distinct pathways that are differentially regulated by Ca(2+), so we investigated these rates and their sensitivity to Ca(2+) using sympathetic neurons as model cells. The rate of Ca(2+) uptake by SERCAs (J(SERCA)), measured as the t-BuBHQ-sensitive component of the total cytoplasmic Ca(2+) flux, increased monotonically with [Ca(2+)](i). Measurement of the rate of Ca(2+) release (J(Release)) during t-BuBHQ-induced [Ca(2+)](i) transients made it possible to characterize the Ca(2+) permeability of the ER (({\~{}})P(ER)), describing the activity of all Ca(2+)-permeable channels that contribute to passive ER Ca(2+) release, including ryanodine-sensitive Ca(2+) release channels (RyRs) that are responsible for CICR. Simulations based on experimentally determined descriptions of J(SERCA), and of Ca(2+) extrusion across the plasma membrane (J(pm)) accounted for our previous finding that during weak depolarization, the ER accumulates Ca(2+), but at a rate that is attenuated by activation of a CICR pathway operating in parallel with SERCAs to regulate net ER Ca(2+) transport. Caffeine greatly increased the [Ca(2+)] sensitivity of (({\~{}})P(ER)), accounting for the effects of caffeine on depolarization-evoked [Ca(2+)](i) elevations and caffeine-induced [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations. Extending the rate descriptions of J(SERCA), (({\~{}})P(ER)), and J(pm) to higher [Ca(2+)](i) levels shows how the interplay between Ca(2+) transport systems with different Ca(2+) sensitivities accounts for the different modes of CICR over different ranges of [Ca(2+)](i) during stimulation.},

abstract = {From a structural perspective, there are ten basic parts of the vertebrate CNS that are almost universally agreed upon. These parts have been grouped in at least five different ways corresponding to five different theories about its basic plan or architecture. Two classical models that remain popular today are derived from (1) comparative anatomy and the body's segmental organization, and (2) comparative embryology and the neural tube's transverse and longitudinal organization. A new approach is concerned with deciphering the genetic program that assembles the nervous system during embryogenesis; how it will correspond to the other models remains to be determined. The simplest current model to explain the organization of the mammalian nervous system involves a segmental trunk that mediates reflex sensory-motor functions, and suprasegmental cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum.},

@article{Kapela2008,
abstract = {A mathematical model of calcium dynamics in vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) was developed based on data mostly from rat mesenteric arterioles. The model focuses on (a) the plasma membrane electrophysiology; (b) Ca2+ uptake and release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR); (c) cytosolic balance of Ca2+, Na+, K+, and Cl ions; and (d) IP3 and cGMP formation in response to norepinephrine(NE) and nitric oxide (NO) stimulation. Stimulation with NE induced membrane depolarization and an intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) transient followed by a plateau. The plateau concentrations were mostly determined by the activation of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. NE causes a greater increase in [Ca2+]i than stimulation with KCl to equivalent depolarization. Model simulations suggest that the effect of[Na+]i accumulation on the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) can potentially account for this difference.Elevation of [Ca2+]i within a concentration window (150-300 nM) by NE or KCl initiated [Ca2+]i oscillations with a concentration-dependent period. The oscillations were generated by the nonlinear dynamics of Ca2+ release and refilling in the SR. NO repolarized the NE-stimulated SMC and restored low [Ca2+]i mainly through its effect on Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Under certain conditions, Na+-K+-ATPase inhibition can result in the elevation of [Na+]i and the reversal of NCX, increasing resting cytosolic and SR Ca2+ content, as well as reactivity to NE. Blockade of the NCX's reverse mode could eliminate these effects. We conclude that the integration of the selected cellular components yields a mathematical model that reproduces, satisfactorily, some of the established features of SMC physiology. Simulations suggest a potential role of intracellular Na+ in modulating Ca2+ dynamics and provide insights into the mechanisms of SMC constriction, relaxation, and the phenomenon of vasomotion. The model will provide the basis for the development of multi-cellular mathematical models that will investigate microcirculatory function in health and disease.},

abstract = {We consider approaches to the numerical difficulties posed by modelling resistive networks with dynamically changing resistances according to a set of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The prototype problem is autoregulation on a cerebral microvascular network. In this network the amount of perfusion, or tissue blood supply, is determined by the resistance of the vascular network. This resistance can be dynamically altered to regulate the amount of blood flow and hence maintain a balance of chemicals and nutrients in the tissue. The mechanisms responsible for this are primarily local, and are due to various chemical pathways to the vascular smooth muscle cells lining the arterioles and arteries in the vasculature. These cells contract and dilate, which alters the radii and hence resistance of the vessels. Because of the global coupling induced by the resistive network, the resulting stiff system of odes has a dense Jacobian which precludes the direct application of traditional implicit numerical solution methods. We consider a means of remedying this problem by taking a block diagonal Jacobian approximation which allows use of an implicit method but retains the desirable property of explicit solvers of linear solution time scaling with problem size. {\textcopyright} Austral.

abstract = {In spite of five decades of study, the biophysics of spreading depression (SD) is incompletely understood. Earlier we have modeled seizures and SD, and we have shown that currents through ion channels normally present in neuron membranes can generate SD-like depolarization. In the present study, we define the conditions for triggering SD and the parameters that influence its course in a model of a hippocampal pyramidal cell with more complete representation of ions and channels than the previous version. "Leak" conductances for Na(+), K(+), and Cl(-) and an ion pump were present in the membrane of the entire cell; fast inactivating voltage dependent conductances for sodium and potassium in the soma; "persistent" conductances in soma and apical dendrite, and K(+)- and voltage-dependent N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-controlled conductance in the apical dendrite. The neuron was surrounded by restricted interstitial space and by a "glia-endothelium" system of extracellular ion regulation bounded by a membrane having leak conductances and an ion pump. Ion fluxes and concentration changes were continuously computed as well as osmotic cell volume changes. As long as reuptake into the neuron and "buffering" by glia kept pace with K(+) released from the neuron, stimulating current applied to the soma evoked repetitive firing that stopped when stimulation ceased. When glial uptake was reduced, K(+) released from neurons could accumulate in the interstitium and keep the neuron depolarized so that strong depolarizing pulses injected into the soma were followed either by afterdischarge or SD. SD-like depolarization was ignited when depolarization spreading into the apical dendrite, activated persistent Na(+) current and NMDA-controlled current. With membrane parameters constant, varying the injected stimulating current influenced SD onset but neither the depolarization nor the increase in extracellular K(+). Glial "leak" conductance influenced SD duration and SD ignition point. Varying maximal conductances (representing channel density) also influenced SD onset time but not the amplitude of the depolarization. Hypoxia was simulated by turning off the Na-K exchange pump, and this resulted in SD-like depolarization. The results confirm that, once ignited, SD runs an all-or-none trajectory, the level of depolarization is governed by feedback involving ion shifts and glutamate acting on ion channels and not by the number of channels open, and SD is ignited if the net persistent membrane current in the apical dendrites turns inward.},

Using electrophysiological depolarization, we directly demonstrate the process of Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release triggered by Ca(2+) entry through voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels.

@article{Kourembanas1993,
abstract = {The mechanisms by which hypoxia causes vasoconstriction in vivo are not known. Accumulating evidence implicates the endothelium as a key regulator of vascular tone. Hypoxia induces the expression and secretion of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor in cultured human endothelial cells. We report here that nitric oxide (NO), an endothelial-derived relaxing factor, modifies this induction of ET-1. Whereas low oxygen tension (PO2 = 20-30 Torr) increases ET-1 expression four- to eightfold above that seen at normal oxygen tension (PO2 = 150 Torr), sodium nitroprusside, which releases NO, suppresses this effect. This inhibition of hypoxia-induced ET-1 expression occurs within the first hour of exposure of cells to sodium nitroprusside. Moreover, when the endogenous constitutive levels of NO made by endothelial cells are suppressed using N-omega-nitro-L-arginine, a potent competitive inhibitor of NO synthase, the baseline levels of ET-1 produced in normoxic environments are increased three- to fourfold. The effects of hypoxia and the NO synthase inhibitor on ET-1 expression are additive. The regulation of ET-1 production by NO appears to be at the level of transcription. Similar effects of NO were observed on the expression of the PDGF-B chain gene. PDGF-B expression was suppressed by NO in a hypoxic environment and induced by N-omega-nitro-L-arginine in both normoxic and hypoxic environments. These findings suggest that in addition to its role as a vasodilator, NO may also influence vascular tone via the regulated reciprocal production of ET-1 and PDGF-B in the vasculature.},

abstract = {In the past two decades, over 1000 clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a benefit in treating stroke, with the exception of thrombolytics. Although many targets have been pursued, including antioxidants, calcium channel blockers, glutamate receptor blockers, and neurotrophic factors, often the focus has been on neuronal mechanisms of injury. Broader attention to loss and dysfunction of non-neuronal cell types is now required to increase the chance of success. Of the several glial cell types, this review will focus on astrocytes. Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the higher mammalian nervous system, and they play key roles in normal CNS physiology and in central nervous system injury and pathology. In the setting of ischemia astrocytes perform multiple functions, some beneficial and some potentially detrimental, making them excellent candidates as therapeutic targets to improve outcome following stroke and in other central nervous system injuries. The older neurocentric view of the central nervous system has changed radically with the growing understanding of the many essential functions of astrocytes. These include K+ buffering, glutamate clearance, brain antioxidant defense, close metabolic coupling with neurons, and modulation of neuronal excitability. In this review, we will focus on those functions of astrocytes that can both protect and endanger neurons, and discuss how manipulating these functions provides a novel and important strategy to enhance neuronal survival and improve outcome following cerebral ischemia.},

With existing commonly used methods, Ca(2+) has been studied only within astrocyte somata and thick branches, leaving the distal fine branchlets and endfeet that are most proximate to neuronal synapses and blood vessels largely unexplored. Here, using cytosolic and membrane-tethered forms of genetically encoded Ca(2+) indicators (GECIs; cyto-GCaMP3 and Lck-GCaMP3), we report well-characterized approaches that overcome these limitations. We used in vivo microinjections of adeno-associated viruses to express GECIs in astrocytes and studied Ca(2+) signals in acute hippocampal slices in vitro from adult mice (aged ∼P80) two weeks after infection. Our data reveal a sparkling panorama of unexpectedly numerous, frequent, equivalently scaled, and highly localized Ca(2+) microdomains within entire astrocyte territories in situ within acute hippocampal slices, consistent with the distribution of perisynaptic branchlets described using electron microscopy. Signals from endfeet were revealed with particular clarity. The tools and experimental approaches we describe in detail allow for the systematic study of Ca(2+) signals within entire astrocytes, including within fine perisynaptic branchlets and vessel-associated endfeet, permitting rigorous evaluation of how astrocytes contribute to brain function.},

abstract = {Many experimental studies have shown that arterial smooth muscle cells respond with cytosolic calcium rises to vasoconstrictor stimulation. A low vasoconstrictor concentration gives rise to asynchronous spikes in the calcium concentration in a few cells (asynchronous flashing). With a greater vasoconstrictor concentration, the number of smooth muscle cells responding in this way increases (recruitment) and calcium oscillations may appear. These oscillations may eventually synchronize and generate arterial contraction and vasomotion. We show that these phenomena of recruitment and synchronization naturally emerge from a model of a population of smooth muscle cells coupled through their gap junctions. The effects of electrical, calcium, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate coupling are studied. A weak calcium coupling is crucial to obtain a synchronization of calcium oscillations and the minimal required calcium permeability is deduced. Moreover, we note that an electrical coupling can generate oscillations, but also has a desynchronizing effect. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate diffusion does not play an important role to achieve synchronization.

abstract = {The term spreading depolarization describes a wave in the gray matter of the central nervous system characterized by swelling of neurons, distortion of dendritic spines, a large change of the slow electrical potential and silencing of brain electrical activity (spreading depression). In the clinic, unequivocal electrophysiological evidence now exists that spreading depolarizations occur abundantly in individuals with aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage, delayed ischemic stroke after subarachnoid hemorrhage, malignant hemispheric stroke, spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage or traumatic brain injury. Spreading depolarization is induced experimentally by various noxious conditions including chemicals such as potassium, glutamate, inhibitors of the sodium pump, status epilepticus, hypoxia, hypoglycemia and ischemia, but it can can also invade healthy, naive tissue. Resistance vessels respond to it with tone alterations, causing either transient hyperperfusion (physiological hemodynamic response) in healthy tissue or severe hypoperfusion (inverse hemodynamic response, or spreading ischemia) in tissue at risk for progressive damage, which contributes to lesion progression. Therapies that target spreading depolarization or the inverse hemodynamic response may potentially treat these neurological conditions.},

abstract = {Endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is the predominant enzyme responsible for vascular NO synthesis. A functional eNOS transfers electrons from NADPH to its heme center, where L-arginine is oxidized to L-citrulline and NO. Common conditions predisposing to atherosclerosis, such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus and smoking, are associated with enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduced amounts of bioactive NO in the vessel wall. NADPH oxidases represent major sources of ROS in cardiovascular pathophysiology. NADPH oxidase-derived superoxide avidly interacts with eNOS-derived NO to form peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)), which oxidizes the essential NOS cofactor (6R-)5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)). As a consequence, oxygen reduction uncouples from NO synthesis, thereby rendering NOS to a superoxide-producing pro-atherosclerotic enzyme. Supplementation with BH(4) corrects eNOS dysfunction in several animal models and in patients. Administration of high local doses of the antioxidant L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) improves endothelial function, whereas large-scale clinical trials do not support a strong role for oral vitamin C and/or E in reducing cardiovascular disease. Statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1 receptor blockers have the potential of reducing vascular oxidative stress. Finally, novel approaches are being tested to block pathways leading to oxidative stress (e.g. protein kinase C) or to upregulate antioxidant enzymes.},

WIT003, ABSA and 20-HETE all had a similar effect to reduce the diameter of the middle cerebral artery by 26{\%}. WIT003 and 20-HETE both increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from the middle cerebral artery. In contrast, WIT002 had no effect on the basal diameter of the middle cerebral artery but it attenuated the vasoconstrictor responses and the rise in [Ca2+]i in vascular smooth muscle cells following administration of 20-HETE and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). WIT003 partially restored the vasoconstrictor response to 5-HT in the middle cerebral artery after administration of an inhibitor of the endogenous synthesis of 20-HETE. Infusion of the 20-HETE agonists, WIT003 and ABSA, into cisterna magna of rats reduced baseline cerebral blood flow by 20{\%}, whereas administration of the 20-HETE antagonist, WIT002, had no effect. Intracisternal injection of WIT002 attenuated the fall in cerebral blood flow following injection of blood into the cisterna magna, whereas administration of the 20-HETE agonist, ABSA, potentiated this response. These findings indicate that the 20-HETE agonists, WIT003 and ABSA, increase cerebral vascular tone both in vivo and in vitro and suggest blocking the vasoconstrictor actions of 20-HETE may be useful to prevent the acute fall in cerebral blood flow following subarachnoid hemorrhage.},

abstract = {Stroke and circulatory arrest cause interferences in blood flow to the brain that result in considerable tissue damage. The primary method to reduce or prevent neurologic damage to patients suffering from brain ischemia is prompt restoration of blood flow to the ischemic tissue. However, paradoxically, restoration of blood flow causes additional damage and exacerbates neurocognitive deficits among patients who suffer a brain ischemic event. Mitochondria play a critical role in reperfusion injury by producing excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) thereby damaging cellular components, and initiating cell death. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the mechanisms of mitochondrial ROS generation during reperfusion, and specifically, the role the mitochondrial membrane potential plays in the pathology of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. Additionally, we propose a temporal model of ROS generation in which posttranslational modifications of key oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) proteins caused by ischemia induce a hyperactive state upon reintroduction of oxygen. Hyperactive OxPhos generates high mitochondrial membrane potentials, a condition known to generate excessive ROS. Such a state would lead to a "burst" of ROS upon reperfusion, thereby causing structural and functional damage to the mitochondria and inducing cell death signaling that eventually culminate in tissue damage. Finally, we propose that strategies aimed at modulating this maladaptive hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential may be a novel therapeutic intervention and present specific studies demonstrating the cytoprotective effect of this treatment modality.},

abstract = {Rapid action potential generation - spiking - and alternating intervals of spiking and quiescence - bursting - are two dynamic patterns commonly observed in neuronal activity. In computational models of neuronal systems, the transition from spiking to bursting often exhibits complex bifurcation structure. One type of transition involves the torus canard, which we show arises in a broad array of well-known computational neuronal models with three different classes of bursting dynamics: sub-Hopf/fold cycle bursting, circle/fold cycle bursting, and fold/fold cycle bursting. The essential features that these models share are multiple time scales leading naturally to decomposition into slow and fast systems, a saddle-node of periodic orbits in the fast system, and a torus bifurcation in the full system. We show that the transition from spiking to bursting in each model system is given by an explosion of torus canards. Based on these examples, as well as on emerging theory, we propose that torus canards are a common dynamic phenomenon separating the regimes of spiking and bursting activity.},

abstract = {Substantial evidence from epidemiological, pathological, and clinical reports suggests that vascular factors are critical in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and changes in blood flow are currently the most reliable indicators of the disease. We previously reported that older APP23 transgenic (tg) mice have significant blood flow alterations correlated with structural modifications of blood vessels. For the present study, our objective was to analyze the age-dependent morphological and architectural changes of the cerebral vasculature of APP23 tg mice. To visualize the 3D arrangement of the entire brain vasculature, we used vascular corrosion casts. Already at young ages, when typically parenchymal amyloid plaques are not yet present, APP23 tg mice had significant alterations, particularly of the microvasculature, often accompanied by small deposits attached to the vessels. In older animals, vasculature abruptly ended at amyloid plaques, resulting in holes. Often, small deposits were sitting near or at the end of truncated vessels. Between such holes, the surrounding vascular array appeared more dense and showed features typical for angiogenesis. We propose that small amyloid aggregates associated with the microvasculature lead to morphological and architectural alterations of the vasculature, resulting in altered local blood flow. The characteristic early onset of vascular alterations suggests that imaging blood flow and/or vasculature architecture could be used as a tool for early diagnosis of the disease and to monitor therapies.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in neurohormonal secretion from median eminence neuroendocrine nerve terminals. We report that stimulation of NO release from median eminence fragments including vascular tissues occurs by $\mu$3 receptor activation by morphine, or by cannabinoid type 1 receptor activation by anandamide. The released levels of NO are lower after anandamide than after morphine stimulation. These processes can be blocked by L-NAME, a specific nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, by naloxone for the morphine-stimulated NO release, or SR 141716A, a specific CB1 receptor inhibitor, for the anandamide-stimulated NO release. Furthermore, morphine and anandamide, by this NO dependent process, influences neurohormonal release from median eminence nerve terminals within 10 min. Via this NO dependent process, morphine stimulates both GnRH and CRF release, whereas anandamide selectively stimulates GnRH release. These observations together with previous data suggest that morphine and the anandamide-stimulated NO originates from the vascular endothelium of the portal plexus. These results indicate that endothelial cells of the median eminence may be involved in the release of neurohormones.},

abstract = {The major pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include amyloid plaques composed primarily of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide, degenerating neurons and neurofibrillary tangles, and the presence of numerous activated astrocytes and microglia. Although extensive genetic data implicate Abeta in the neurodegenerative cascade of AD, the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects on neurons and glia and the relationship between glial activation and neuronal death are not well defined. Abeta has been shown to induce glial activation, and a growing body of evidence suggests that activated glia contribute to neurotoxicity through generation of inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic free radicals, such as nitric oxide (NO), potent sources of oxidative stress known to occur in AD. It is therefore crucial to identify specific Abeta-induced molecular pathways mediating these responses in activated glia. We report that Abeta stimulates the activation of the transcription factor NFkappaB in rat astrocytes, that NFkappaB activation occurs selectively from p65 transactivation domain 2, and that Abeta-induced NO synthase expression and NO production occur through an NFkappaB-dependent mechanism. This demonstration of how Abeta couples an intracellular signal transduction pathway involving NFkappaB to a potentially neurotoxic response provides a key mechanistic link between Abeta and the generation of oxidative damage. Our results also suggest possible molecular targets upon which to focus future drug discovery efforts for AD.},

abstract = {A mathematical model of the cardiac ventricular action potential is presented. In our previous work, the membrane Na+ current and K+ currents were formulated. The present article focuses on processes that regulate intracellular Ca2+ and depend on its concentration. The model presented here for the mammalian ventricular action potential is based mostly on the guinea pig ventricular cell. However, it provides the framework for modeling other types of ventricular cells with appropriate modifications made to account for species differences. The following processes are formulated: Ca2+ current through the L-type channel (ICa), the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger, Ca2+ release and uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), buffering of Ca2+ in the SR and in the myoplasm, a Ca2+ pump in the sarcolemma, the Na(+)-K+ pump, and a nonspecific Ca(2+)-activated membrane current. Activation of ICa is an order of magnitude faster than in previous models. Inactivation of ICa depends on both the membrane voltage and [Ca2+]i. SR is divided into two subcompartments, a network SR (NSR) and a junctional SR (JSR). Functionally, Ca2+ enters the NSR and translocates to the JSR following a monoexponential function. Release of Ca2+ occurs at JSR and can be triggered by two different mechanisms, Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release and spontaneous release. The model provides the basis for the study of arrhythmogenic activity of the single myocyte including afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. It can simulate cellular responses under different degrees of Ca2+ overload. Such simulations are presented in our accompanying article in this issue of Circulation Research.},

abstract = {An imbalance of intracellular calcium homeostasis induced by amyloid $\beta$-protein (A$\beta$) contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer׳s disease (AD), such as deficits in learning and memory. Therefore, regulation of calcium homeostasis may represent a new strategy for treatment of AD. Growing evidence suggests that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and AD are closely related in pathogenesis. Thus, drugs used in treatment of T2DM may modify the pathogenesis of AD. This study demonstrated that Exendin-4, which is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog used as a therapeutic drug for T2DM, significantly antagonized suppression of long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by A$\beta$1-42 in the rat hippocampal CA1 region in vivo. This neuroprotection may be mediated by regulation of calcium homeostasis. Pretreatment with Exendin-4 suppressed A$\beta$1-42-induced elevation in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) through L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (L-VDCCs) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Furthermore, Exendin-4 antagonized the decrease in p-Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II$\alpha$ (p-CaMKII$\alpha$) induced by A$\beta$1-42 in the rat hippocampal CA1 region. Thus, the neuroprotective effects of Exendin-4, which likely involve regulation of calcium homeostasis, provide theoretical support for using Exendin-4 to treat and prevent AD in the future.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) exists in three established isoforms. NOS I (NOS1, ncNOS) was originally discovered in neurons. This enzyme and splice variants thereof have since been found in many other cells and tissues. NOS II (NOS2, iNOS) was first identified in murine macrophages, but can also be induced in many other cell types. NOS III (NOS3, ecNOS) is expressed mainly in endothelial cells. Whereas NOS II is a transcriptionally regulated enzyme, NOS I and NOS III are considered constitutively expressed proteins. However, evidence generated in recent years indicates that these two isoforms are also subject to expressional regulation. In view of the important biological functions of these isoforms, changes in their expression may have physiological and pathophysiological consequences. This review recapitulates compounds and conditions that modulate the expression of NOS I and NOS III, summarizes transcriptional and posttranscriptional effects that underlie these changes, and-where known-describes the molecular mechanisms leading to changes in transcription, RNA stability, or translation of these enzymes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The evidence base on the prevalence of dementia is expanding rapidly, particularly in countries with low and middle incomes. A reappraisal of global prevalence and numbers is due, given the significant implications for social and public policy and planning. METHODS: In this study we provide a systematic review of the global literature on the prevalence of dementia (1980-2009) and metaanalysis to estimate the prevalence and numbers of those affected, aged {\textgreater}/=60 years in 21 Global Burden of Disease regions. RESULTS: Age-standardized prevalence for those aged {\textgreater}/=60 years varied in a narrow band, 5{\%}-7{\%} in most world regions, with a higher prevalence in Latin America (8.5{\%}), and a distinctively lower prevalence in the four sub-Saharan African regions (2{\%}-4{\%}). It was estimated that 35.6 million people lived with dementia worldwide in 2010, with numbers expected to almost double every 20 years, to 65.7 million in 2030 and 115.4 million in 2050. In 2010, 58{\%} of all people with dementia lived in countries with low or middle incomes, with this proportion anticipated to rise to 63{\%} in 2030 and 71{\%} in 2050. CONCLUSION: The detailed estimates in this study constitute the best current basis for policymaking, planning, and allocation of health and welfare resources in dementia care. The age-specific prevalence of dementia varies little between world regions, and may converge further. Future projections of numbers of people with dementia may be modified substantially by preventive interventions (lowering incidence), improvements in treatment and care (prolonging survival), and disease-modifying interventions (preventing or slowing progression). All countries need to commission nationally representative surveys that are repeated regularly to monitor trends.},

abstract = {Brain imaging methods, and in particular fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging), do not detect neural activity directly, but rather changes in blood flow and oxygenation in neighboring blood vessels, this being the BOLD (Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent) effect. We have constructed a model of the steps leading from neural activity to increased blood flow in arterioles, in which astrocytes play a crucial role. Glutamate released from neuronal synapses binds to metabotropic receptors on the astrocyte processes that ensheath these synapses. This initiates a calcium wave that travels along the endfeet of astrocytes that abut the endothelial cells forming the walls of blood capillaries; this calcium wave is propagated by the extracellular diffusion of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) that acts on metabotropic purinergic receptors on the astrocytes. A further second messenger (taken to be nitric oxide) relays this signal to the smooth muscle cells forming the outer walls of arterioles, and the subsequent wave of hyperpolarization reduces calcium influx and allows relaxation of the muscle cells and hence increased blood flow. The model gives results that are in agreement with experimental measurements of blood volume changes in the arterioles in the visual cortex of optically stimulated cats. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Although spiral waves are ubiquitous features of nature and have been observed in many biological systems, their existence and potential function in mammalian cerebral cortex remain uncertain. Using voltage-sensitive dye imaging, we found that spiral waves occur frequently in the neocortex in vivo, both during pharmacologically induced oscillations and during sleep-like states. While their life span is limited, spiral waves can modify ongoing cortical activity by influencing oscillation frequencies and spatial coherence and by reducing amplitude in the area surrounding the spiral phase singularity. During sleep-like states, the rate of occurrence of spiral waves varies greatly depending on brain states. These results support the hypothesis that spiral waves, as an emergent activity pattern, can organize and modulate cortical population activity on the mesoscopic scale and may contribute to both normal cortical processing and to pathological patterns of activity such as those found in epilepsy.},

Although no direct information from topographic anatomy enters the model, computer- generated CCO trees closely resemble corrosion casts of real arterial trees, both on a visual basis and with regard to morphometric parameters. Terminal flow variability was found to induce transitions in the connective structure early in the trees' development. The present generalization of CCO offers - for the first time - the possibility to generate optimized arterial model trees in three dimensions, representing a realistic geometrical substrate for hemodynamic simulation studies. With the implementation of terminal flow variability the model is ready to simulate processes such as the adaptation of arterial diameters to changes in blood flow rate or the formation of different patterns of angiogenesis induced by changing needs of blood supply.},

abstract = {The temperature distribution and rate of heat transfer across an infinite periodic strip of a honeycomb lattice consisting of conductive segments or links joined at nodes or junctions is discussed. A pristine honeycomb behaves like an isotropic medium whose effective conductivity is independent of the orientation of an applied macroscopic temperature gradient. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to determine the effect of link damage or disruption and lattice deformation due to junction displacement. In the simulations, a specified percentage of randomly distributed links are assigned a conductivity that is lower than that of the undamaged links. The balance equations governing the nodal temperatures at the junctions are solved by iteration subject to a periodicity condition along the strip and the Dirichlet condition along the two infinite edges of the strip. The results illustrate the effect of imperfections on the temperature distribution over the network and document the dependence of the effective conductivity on the percentage and conductivity of the defective links. In the case of nonconductive damaged links, the effective conductivity becomes nearly zero when a critical percentage of links are clipped, in agreement with bond percolation theory. However, the functional form of the number density of possible pathways connecting the lower to the upper edge of the strip predicted by percolation theory differs from that of the effective conductivity. Lattice deformation due to random node displacement has a small effect on the effective conductivity of the network. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {System x(c)(-) represents an intriguing target in attempts to understand the pathological states of the central nervous system. Also called a cystine-glutamate antiporter, system x(c)(-) typically functions by exchanging one molecule of extracellular cystine for one molecule of intracellular glutamate. Nonvesicular glutamate released during cystine-glutamate exchange activates extrasynaptic glutamate receptors in a manner that shapes synaptic activity and plasticity. These findings contribute to the intriguing possibility that extracellular glutamate is regulated by a complex network of release and reuptake mechanisms, many of which are unique to glutamate and rarely depicted in models of excitatory signaling. Because system x(c)(-) is often expressed on non-neuronal cells, the study of cystine-glutamate exchange may advance the emerging viewpoint that glia are active contributors to information processing in the brain. It is noteworthy that system x(c)(-) is at the interface between excitatory signaling and oxidative stress, because the uptake of cystine that results from cystine-glutamate exchange is critical in maintaining the levels of glutathione, a critical antioxidant. As a result of these dual functions, system x(c)(-) has been implicated in a wide array of central nervous system diseases ranging from addiction to neurodegenerative disorders to schizophrenia. In the current review, we briefly discuss the major cellular components that regulate glutamate homeostasis, including glutamate release by system x(c)(-). This is followed by an in-depth discussion of system x(c)(-) as it relates to glutamate release, cystine transport, and glutathione synthesis. Finally, the role of system x(c)(-) is surveyed across a number of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, with progressive cognitive deficits being the primary symptom. AD is neuropathologically characterized by amyloid and neurofibrillary tangle depositions, basal forebrain cholinergic deficit, and extensive neuronal loss and synaptic changes in the cortex and hippocampus. Mutations of amyloid precursor protein or presenilin genes or apolipoprotein E gene polymorphism appear to affect amyloid formation, which in turn causes neuronal death via a number of possible mechanisms, including Ca2+ homeostasis disruption, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, energy depletion, neuro-inflammation and apoptosis. Nitric oxide (NO) is an enzymatic product of nitric oxide synthase, which exists in three isoforms. In addition to its vasoactive and immunological properties, NO has significant neurophysiological functions. However, NO can also be neurotoxic primarily due to its free radical properties, and it has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, there is increasing evidence that NO may have a role in the aforementioned AD pathogenetic mechanisms, and putative links between NO and AD are beginning to be recognized. This review focuses on these issues highlighting the possible relevance of NO in AD, either as a neuroprotective or neurotoxic agent. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors are widely expressed in the brain and are critical for many forms of synaptic plasticity. Subtypes of the NMDA receptor NR2 subunit are differentially expressed during development; in the forebrain, the NR2B receptor is dominant early in development, and later both NR2A and NR2B are expressed. In heterologous expression systems, NR2A-containing receptors open more reliably and show much faster opening and closing kinetics than do NR2B-containing receptors. However, conflicting data, showing similar open probabilities, exist for receptors expressed in neurons. Similarly, studies of synaptic plasticity have produced divergent results, with some showing that only NR2A-containing receptors can drive long-term potentiation and others showing that either subtype is capable of driving potentiation. In order to address these conflicting results as well as open questions about the number and location of functional receptors in the synapse, we constructed a Monte Carlo model of glutamate release, diffusion, and binding to NMDA receptors and of receptor opening and closing as well as a model of the activation of calcium-calmodulin kinase II, an enzyme critical for induction of synaptic plasticity, by NMDA receptor-mediated calcium influx. Our results suggest that the conflicting data concerning receptor open probabilities can be resolved, with NR2A- and NR2B-containing receptors having very different opening probabilities. They also support the conclusion that receptors containing either subtype can drive long-term potentiation. We also are able to estimate the number of functional receptors at a synapse from experimental data. Finally, in our models, the opening of NR2B-containing receptors is highly dependent on the location of the receptor relative to the site of glutamate release whereas the opening of NR2A-containing receptors is not. These results help to clarify the previous findings and suggest future experiments to address open questions concerning NMDA receptor function.},

Purkinje cells responded with large inward currents accompanied by increases in dendritic [Ca2+]i, when challenged with the excitatory amino acid agonists glutamate and quisqualate. The rise in [Ca2+]i was transient and reached peak values of several hundred nanomolar. The response subsisted in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, a condition that eliminates Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, indicating that Ca2+ arose in large part from an intracellular compartment. In support of this hypothesis, only the first agonist application elicited a [Ca2+]i increase in slices maintained in Ca 2+-free medium, as expected if the intracellular stores become depleted. These results indicate that metabotropic glutamate receptors are functional in Purkinje cells and point to glutamate as a possible modulator of [Ca2+]i in these neurons.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (*NO) is a diffusible intercellular messenger, acting via volume signaling in the brain and, therefore, the knowledge of its temporal dynamics is determinant to the understanding of its neurobiological role. However, such an analysis in vivo is challenging and indirect or static approaches are mostly used to infer *NO bioactivity. In the present work we measured the glutamate-dependent *NO temporal dynamics in vivo in the hippocampus (CA1, CA3 and DG subregions), cerebral cortex and striatum, using *NO selective microelectrodes. Concurrently, the immunolocalization of nNOS was evaluated in each region. A transitory increase in *NO levels occurred at higher amplitudes in the striatum and hippocampus relatively to the cortex. In the hippocampus, subtle differences in the profiles of *NO signals were observed along the trisynaptic loop, with CA1 exhibiting the largest signals. The topography of *NO temporal dynamics did not fully overlap with the pattern of the density of nNOS expression, suggesting that, complementary to the distribution of nNOS, the local regulation of *NO synthesis as well as the decay pathways critically determine the effective *NO concentration sensed by a target within the diffusional spread of this free radical. In sum, the rate and pattern of *NO changes here shown, by incorporating regulatory mechanisms and processes that affect *NO synthesis and decay, provide refined information critical for the understanding of *NO multiple actions in the brain. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This textbook provides an introduction to dynamic modeling in cell biology, emphasizing computational approaches based on realistic molecular mechanisms. It is designed to introduce cell biology and neuroscience students to computational modeling, and applied mathematics students, theoretical biologists, and engineers to many of the problems in dynamical cell biology. This volume was conceived of and begun by Professor Joel Keizer based on his many years of teaching and research together with his colleagues. The project was expanded and finished by his students and friends after his untimely death in 1999. Carefully selected examples are used to motivate the concepts and techniques of computational cell biology, through a progression of increasingly more complex and demanding cases. Illustrative exercises are included with every chapter, and mathematical and computational appendices are provided for reference. This textbook will be useful for advanced undergraduate and graduate theoretical biologists, and for mathematics students and life scientists who wish to learn about modeling in cell biology. Royalties from this book will be donated to the Joel E. Keizer memorial endowment for collaborative interdisciplinary research in the life sciences.},

abstract = {Dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) is impaired following stroke. However, the relationship between dCA, brain atrophy, and functional outcomes following stroke remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine whether impairment of dCA is associated with atrophy in specific regions or globally, thereby affecting daily functions in stroke patients.We performed a retrospective analysis of 33 subjects with chronic infarctions in the middle cerebral artery territory, and 109 age-matched non-stroke subjects. dCA was assessed via the phase relationship between arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity. Brain tissue volumes were quantified from MRI. Functional status was assessed by gait speed, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), modified Rankin Scale, and NIH Stroke Score.Compared to the non-stroke group, stroke subjects showed degraded dCA bilaterally, and showed gray matter atrophy in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes ipsilateral to infarct. In stroke subjects, better dCA was associated with less temporal lobe gray matter atrophy on the infracted side ([Formula: see text] = 0.029), faster gait speed ([Formula: see text] = 0.018) and lower IADL score ([Formula: see text]0.002). Our results indicate that better dynamic cerebral perfusion regulation is associated with less atrophy and better long-term functional status in older adults with chronic ischemic infarctions.},

abstract = {The main receptors for amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) from brain to blood and blood to brain are low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP1) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), respectively. In normal human plasma a soluble form of LRP1 (sLRP1) is a major endogenous brain Abeta 'sinker' that sequesters some 70 to 90 {\%} of plasma Abeta peptides. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the levels of sLRP1 and its capacity to bind Abeta are reduced which increases free Abeta fraction in plasma. This in turn may increase brain Abeta burden through decreased Abeta efflux and/or increased Abeta influx across the BBB. In Abeta immunotherapy, anti-Abeta antibody sequestration of plasma Abeta enhances the peripheral Abeta 'sink action'. However, in contrast to endogenous sLRP1 which does not penetrate the BBB, some anti-Abeta antibodies may slowly enter the brain which reduces the effectiveness of their sink action and may contribute to neuroinflammation and intracerebral hemorrhage. Anti-Abeta antibody/Abeta immune complexes are rapidly cleared from brain to blood via FcRn (neonatal Fc receptor) across the BBB. In a mouse model of AD, restoring plasma sLRP1 with recombinant LRP-IV cluster reduces brain Abeta burden and improves functional changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and behavioral responses, without causing neuroinflammation and/or hemorrhage. The C-terminal sequence of Abeta is required for its direct interaction with sLRP and LRP-IV cluster which is completely blocked by the receptor-associated protein (RAP) that does not directly bind Abeta. Therapies to increase LRP1 expression or reduce RAGE activity at the BBB and/or restore the peripheral Abeta 'sink' action, hold potential to reduce brain Abeta and inflammation, and improve CBF and functional recovery in AD models, and by extension in AD patients.},

A wide range of approaches have been pursued to control spatiotemporal dynamics, from periodic forcing of medium excitability to imposing static and dynamic heterogeneities and geometric constraints on the medium to global feedback with and without delays. We focus on the design and control of spatiotemporal dynamics in excitable and oscillatory media. Experimental examples are taken from the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction and the oxidation reaction of CO on single crystal Pt, which have become paradigmatic chemical systems for studies of spatiotemporal dynamics. We present theoretical characterizations of spatiotemporal dynamics and control based on the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation as well as models of the BZ and CO/Pt reactions. Controlling spatiotemporal dynamics allows the realization of specific modes of behavior or may give rise to completely new types of behavior. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {To study the effect of myoendothelial communication on vascular reactivity, we integrated detailed mathematical models of Ca(2+) dynamics and membrane electrophysiology in arteriolar smooth muscle (SMC) and endothelial (EC) cells. Cells are coupled through the exchange of Ca(2+), Cl(-), K(+), and Na(+) ions, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP(3)), and the paracrine diffusion of nitric oxide (NO). EC stimulation reduces intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) in the SMC by transmitting a hyperpolarizing current carried primarily by K(+). The NO-independent endothelium-derived hyperpolarization was abolished in a synergistic-like manner by inhibition of EC SK(Ca) and IK(Ca) channels. During NE stimulation, IP(3) diffusing from the SMC induces EC Ca(2+) release, which, in turn, moderates SMC depolarization and [Ca(2+)](i) elevation. On the contrary, SMC [Ca(2+)](i) was not affected by EC-derived IP(3). Myoendothelial Ca(2+) fluxes had no effect in either cell. The EC exerts a stabilizing effect on calcium-induced calcium release-dependent SMC Ca(2+) oscillations by increasing the norepinephrine concentration window for oscillations. We conclude that a model based on independent data for subcellular components can capture major features of the integrated vessel behavior. This study provides a tissue-specific approach for analyzing complex signaling mechanisms in the vasculature.},

abstract = {Large-conductance Ca-activated potassium channels (BK channels) are uniquely sensitive to both membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+. Recent work has demonstrated that in the gating of these channels there are voltage-sensitive steps that are separate from Ca2+ binding steps. Based on this result and the macroscopic steady state and kinetic properties of the cloned BK channel mslo, we have recently proposed a general kinetic scheme to describe the interaction between voltage and Ca2+ in the gating of the mslo channel (Cui, J., D.H. Cox, and R.W. Aldrich. 1997. J. Gen. Physiol. In press.). This scheme supposes that the channel exists in two main conformations, closed and open. The conformational change between closed and open is voltage dependent. Ca2+ binds to both the closed and open conformations, but on average binds more tightly to the open conformation and thereby promotes channel opening. Here we describe the basic properties of models of this form and test their ability to mimic mslo macroscopic steady state and kinetic behavior. The simplest form of this scheme corresponds to a voltage-dependent version of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model of allosteric proteins. The success of voltage-dependent MWC models in describing many aspects of mslo gating suggests that these channels may share a common molecular mechanism with other allosteric proteins whose behaviors have been modeled using the MWC formalism. We also demonstrate how this scheme can arise as a simplification of a more complex scheme that is based on the premise that the channel is a homotetramer with a single Ca2+ binding site and a single voltage sensor in each subunit. Aspects of the mslo data not well fitted by the simplified scheme will likely be better accounted for by this more general scheme. The kinetic schemes discussed in this paper may be useful in interpreting the effects of BK channel modifications or mutations.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) has emerged as a key mediator in the mechanisms of ischaemic tolerance induced by a wide variety of preconditioning stimuli. NO is involved in the brain protection that develops either early (minutes-hours) or late (days-weeks) after the preconditioning stimulus. However, the sources of NO and the mechanisms underlying the protective effects differ substantially. While in early preconditioning NO is produced by the endothelial and neuronal isoform of NO synthase, in delayed preconditioning NO is synthesized by the inducible or 'immunological' isoform of NO synthase. Furthermore, in early preconditioning, NO acts through the canonical cGMP pathway, possibly through protein kinase G and opening of mitochondrial K(ATP) channels. In late preconditioning, the protection is mediated by peroxynitrite formed by the reaction of NO with superoxide derived from the enzyme NADPH oxidase. The mechanisms by which peroxynitrite exerts its protective effect may include improvement of post-ischaemic cerebrovascular function, leading to enhancement of blood flow to the ischaemic territory, and expression of prosurvival genes resulting in cytoprotection. The evidence suggests that NO can engage highly effective and multifunctional prosurvival pathways, which could be exploited for the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular pathologies.},

Herein, we explore a possible role for L-arginine (L-arg) in AD, taking into consideration known functions for L-arg in atherosclerosis, redox stress and the inflammatory process, regulation of synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis, and modulation of glucose metabolism and insulin activity. L-arg, a precursor of nitric oxide and polyamine, exhibits multiple functions in human health and may play a prominent role in age-related degenerative diseases such as AD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 4 (TRPV4) channels are expressed in brain endothelial cells, but their role in regulating cerebrovascular tone under physiological and pathological conditions is still largely unknown. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Wild-type (WT) mice and mice that overexpress a mutated form of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP mice, model of increased amyloid $\beta$), a constitutively active form of TGF-$\beta$1 (TGF mice, model of cerebrovascular fibrosis) or both (APP/TGF mice) were used. Dilations to the selective TRPV4 channel opener GSK1016790A (GSK) or to ACh were measured in posterior cerebral artery segments. KEY RESULTS: Both GSK- and ACh-induced dilations virtually disappeared following endothelium denudation in WT mice. These responses were impaired in vessels from APP, TGF and APP/TGF mice compared with WT. Pre-incubation of WT vessels with the selective TRPV4 channel blocker HC-067047, or with small-conductance (SK channel, apamin) and/or intermediate-conductance (IK channel, charybdotoxin, ChTx) Ca(2+) -sensitive K(+) channel blocker abolished GSK-induced dilations and massively decreased those induced by ACh. These treatments had no or limited effects on ACh-induced dilation in vessels from APP, TGF or APP/TGF mice, and IK and SK channel function was preserved in transgenic mice. Antioxidant superoxide dismutase or catalase normalized GSK- and ACh-mediated dilations only in APP brain arteries. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: We conclude that endothelial TRPV4 channels mediate ACh-induced dilation in cerebral arteries, that they are impaired in models of cerebrovascular pathology and that they are sensitive, albeit in the reversible manner, to amyloid $\beta$-induced oxidative stress.},

abstract = {A numerical model of neurovascular coupling (NVC) is presented based on neuronal activity coupled to vasodilation/contraction models via the astrocytic mediated perivascular K(+) and the smooth muscle cell Ca(2+) pathway. Luminal agonists acting on P2Y receptors on the endothelial cell surface provide a flux of IP3 into the endothelial cytosol. This concentration of IP3 is transported via gap junctions between endothelial and smooth muscle cells providing a source of sacroplasmic derived Ca(2+) in the smooth muscle cell. The model is able to relate a neuronal input signal to the corresponding vessel reaction. Results indicate that blood flow mediated IP3 production via the agonist ATP has a substantial effect on the contraction/dilation dynamics of the SMC. The resulting variation in cytosolic Ca(2+) can enhance and inhibit the flow of blood to the cortical tissue. IP3 coupling between endothelial and smooth muscle cells seems to be important in the dynamics of the smooth muscle cell. The VOCC channels are, due to the hyperpolarisation from K(+) SMC efflux, almost entirely closed and do not seem to play a significant role during neuronal activity. The current model shows that astrocytic Ca(2+) is not necessary for neurovascular coupling to occur in contrast to a number of experiments outlining the importance of astrocytic Ca(2+) in NVC, however this Ca(2+) pathway is not the only one mediating NVC. Importantly agonists in flowing blood have a significant influence on the endothelial and smooth muscle cell dynamics.},

abstract = {Calcium signaling in C6 glioma cells in culture was examined with digital fluorescence video microscopy. C6 cells express low levels of the gap junction protein connexin43 and have correspondingly weak gap junctional communication as evidenced by dye coupling (Naus, C. C. G., J. F. Bechberger, S. Caveney, and J. X. Wilson. 1991. Neurosci. Lett. 126:33-36). Transfection of C6 cells with the cDNA encoding connexin43 resulted in clones with increased expression of connexin43 mRNA and protein and increased dye coupling, as well as markedly reduced rates of proliferation (Zhu, D., S. Caveney, G. M. Kidder, and C. C. Naus. 1991. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 88:1883-1887; Naus, C. C. G., D. Zhu, S. Todd, and G. M. Kidder. 1992. Cell Mol. Neurobiol. 12:163-175). Mechanical stimulation of a single cell in a culture of non-transfected C6 cells induced a wave of increased intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) that showed little or no communication to adjacent cells. By contrast, mechanical stimulation of a single cell in cultures of C6 clones expressing transfected connexin43 cDNA induced a Ca2+ wave that was communicated to multiple surrounding cells, and the extent of communication was proportional to the level of expression of the connexin43 cDNA. These results provide direct evidence that intercellular Ca2+ signaling occurs via gap junctions. Ca2+ signaling through gap junctions may provide a means for the coordinated regulation of cellular function, including cell growth and differentiation.},

abstract = {Smooth muscle and endothelial cells in the arterial wall are exposed
to mechanical stress. Indeed blood flow induces intraluminal pressure
variations and shear stress. An increase in pressure may induce a
vessel contraction, a phenomenon known as the myogenic response.
Many muscular vessels present vasomotion, i.e., rhythmic diameter
oscillations caused by synchronous cytosolic calcium oscillations
of the smooth muscle cells. Vasomotion has been shown to be modulated
by pressure changes. To get a better understanding of the effect
of stress and in particular pressure on vasomotion, we propose a
model of a blood vessel describing the calcium dynamics in a coupled
population of smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells and the consequent
vessel diameter variations. We show that a rise in pressure increases
the calcium concentration. This may either induce or abolish vasomotion,
or increase its frequency depending on the initial conditions. In
our model the myogenic response is less pronounced for large arteries
than for small arteries and occurs at higher values of pressure if
the wall thickness is increased. Our results are in agreement with
experimental observations concerning a broad range of vessels.},

The degree of gap junctional protein expression and intercellular coupling efficiency, as well as hemichannel function has substantially impact on the course of trauma recovery and outcome. During TBI, gap junctions are especially involved in the intercellular molecule trafficking on repair of blood vessels and the regulation of vasomotor tone. Furthermore, gliosis and astrocytic swelling due to mechanical strain injury point out the consequences of derailed gap junction communication. This review addresses the outstanding role of gap junction channels in TBI pathophysiology and links the current state of results to applied clinical procedures as well as perspectives in acute and long-term treatment options.},

abstract = {Based upon theory, wall shear stress (WSS), an important determinant of endothelial function and gene expression, has been assumed to be constant along the arterial tree and the same in a particular artery across species. In vivo measurements of WSS, however, have shown that these assumptions are far from valid. In this survey we will discuss the assessment of WSS in the arterial system in vivo and present the results obtained in large arteries and arterioles. In vivo WSS can be estimated from wall shear rate, as derived from non-invasively recorded velocity profiles, and whole blood viscosity in large arteries and plasma viscosity in arterioles, avoiding theoretical assumptions. In large arteries velocity profiles can be recorded by means of a specially designed ultrasound system and in arterioles via optical techniques using fluorescent flow velocity tracers. It is shown that in humans mean WSS is substantially higher in the carotid artery (1.1-1.3 Pa) than in the brachial (0.4-0.5 Pa) and femoral (0.3-0.5 Pa) arteries. Also in animals mean WSS varies substantially along the arterial tree. Mean WSS in arterioles varies between about 1.0 and 5.0 Pa in the various studies and is dependent on the site of measurement in these vessels. Across species mean WSS in a particular artery decreases linearly with body mass, e.g., in the infra-renal aorta from 8.8 Pa in mice to 0.5 Pa in humans. The observation that mean WSS is far from constant along the arterial tree implies that Murray's cube law on flow-diameter relations cannot be applied to the whole arterial system. Because blood flow velocity is not constant along the arterial tree either, a square law also does not hold. The exponent in the power law likely varies along the arterial system, probably from 2 in large arteries near the heart to 3 in arterioles. The in vivo findings also imply that in in vitro studies no average shear stress value can be taken to study effects on endothelial cells derived from different vascular areas or from the same artery in different species. The cells have to be studied under the shear stress conditions they are exposed to in real life.},

abstract = {This study shows how sensitivity analysis and subset selection can be employed in a cardiovascular model to estimate total systemic resistance, cerebrovascular resistance, arterial compliance, and time for peak systolic ventricular pressure for healthy young and elderly subjects. These quantities are parameters in a simple lumped parameter model that predicts pressure and flow in the systemic circulation. The model is combined with experimental measurements of blood flow velocity from the middle cerebral artery and arterial finger blood pressure. To estimate the model parameters we use nonlinear optimization combined with sensitivity analysis and subset selection. Sensitivity analysis allows us to rank model parameters from the most to the least sensitive with respect to the output states (cerebral blood flow velocity and arterial blood pressure). Subset selection allows us to identify a set of independent candidate parameters that can be estimated given limited data. Analyses of output from both methods allow us to identify five independent sensitive parameters that can be estimated given the data. Results show that with the advance of age total systemic and cerebral resistances increase, that time for peak systolic ventricular pressure is increases, and that arterial compliance is reduced. Thus, the method discussed in this study provides a new methodology to extract clinical markers that cannot easily be assessed noninvasively.},

abstract = {We developed a mathematical model to investigate the production and transport of nitric oxide (NO) generated by a monolayer of cultured endothelial cells exposed to flow in a parallel plate flow chamber. The objectives were to provide a theoretical framework for interpreting experimental observations and to suggest a quantitative relationship between shear stress and NO production rate. NO production was described as a combination of a basal production rate term and a shear-dependent term. Our results show that the shear stress-dependence of the production of NO by the endothelium influences the nature of mass transport within the boundary layer. We found that the steady state NO concentration near the endothelial surface exhibits a biphasic dependence on shear stress, in which at low flow, NO concentration decreases owing to the enhanced removal by convective transport while only at higher shear stresses does the increased production cause an increase in NO concentration. The unsteady response to step changes in flow exhibits transient fluctuations in NO that can be explained by time-dependent changes in the diffusive and convective mass transport as the concentration profile evolves. Our results indicate that this model can be used to determine the relationship between shear stress and NO production rate from measurements of NO concentration.},

abstract = {Neuron-glia signaling is important for neural development and functions. This signaling may be regulated by neuronal activity and undergo modification similar to long-term potentiation (LTP) of neuronal synapses, a hallmark of neuronal plasticity. We found that tetanic stimulation of Schaffer collaterals (Sc) in the hippocampus that induced LTP in neurons also resulted in LTP-like persistent elevation of Sc-evoked slow depolarization in perisynaptic astrocytes. The elevated slow depolarization in astrocytes was abolished by NMDA receptor antagonist and K(+) channel inhibitors, but not by Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA loaded in the recorded astrocytes, suggesting involvement of an increased extracellular K(+) accumulation accompanying LTP of neuronal synapses. The increased K(+) accumulation and astrocyte depolarization after LTP induction may reduce the efficiency of glial glutamate transporters, which may contribute to the enhanced synaptic efficacy. The neuronal activity-induced persistent enhancement of neuron-glia signaling may thus have important physiological relevance.},

abstract = {From a structural perspective, the predominant glial cell of the central nervous system, the astrocyte, is positioned to regulate synaptic transmission and neurovascular coupling: the processes of one astrocyte contact tens of thousands of synapses, while other processes of the same cell form endfeet on capillaries and arterioles. The application of subcellular imaging of Ca2+ signaling to astrocytes now provides functional data to support this structural notion. Astrocytes express receptors for many neurotransmitters, and their activation leads to oscillations in internal Ca2+. These oscillations induce the accumulation of arachidonic acid and the release of the chemical transmitters glutamate, d-serine, and ATP. Ca2+ oscillations in astrocytic endfeet can control cerebral microcirculation through the arachidonic acid metabolites prostaglandin E2 and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids that induce arteriole dilation, and 20-HETE that induces arteriole constriction. In addition to actions on the vasculature, the release of chemical transmitters from astrocytes regulates neuronal function. Astrocyte-derived glutamate, which preferentially acts on extrasynaptic receptors, can promote neuronal synchrony, enhance neuronal excitability, and modulate synaptic transmission. Astrocyte-derived d-serine, by acting on the glycine-binding site of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, can modulate synaptic plasticity. Astrocyte-derived ATP, which is hydrolyzed to adenosine in the extracellular space, has inhibitory actions and mediates synaptic cross-talk underlying heterosynaptic depression. Now that we appreciate this range of actions of astrocytic signaling, some of the immediate challenges are to determine how the astrocyte regulates neuronal integration and how both excitatory (glutamate) and inhibitory signals (adenosine) provided by the same glial cell act in concert to regulate neuronal function.},

abstract = {In a weakly excitable medium, characterized by a large threshold stimulus, the free end of an isolated broken plane wave (wave tip) can either rotate (steadily or unsteadily) around a large excitable core, thereby producing a spiral pattern, or retract, causing the wave to vanish at boundaries. An asymptotic analysis of spiral motion and retraction is carried out in this weakly excitable large core regime starting from the free-boundary limit of the reaction-diffusion models, valid when the excited region is delimited by a thin interface. The wave description is shown to naturally split between the tip region and a far region that are smoothly matched on an intermediate scale. This separation allows us to rigorously derive an equation of motion for the wave tip, with the large scale motion of the spiral wave front slaved to the tip. This kinematic description provides both a physical picture and exact predictions for a wide range of wave behavior, including (i) steady rotation (frequency and core radius), (ii) exact treatment of the meandering instability in the free-boundary limit with the prediction that the frequency of unstable motion is half the primary steady frequency, (iii) drift under external actions (external field with application to axisymmetric scroll ring motion in three dimensions, and spatial- or/and time-dependent variation of excitability), and (iv) the dynamics of multiarmed spiral waves with the prediction that steadily rotating waves with two or more arms are linearly unstable. Numerical simulations of FitzHugh-Nagumo kinetics are used to test several aspects of our results. In addition, we discuss the semiquantitative extension of this theory to finite cores and pinpoint mathematical subtleties related to the thin interface limit of singly diffusive reaction-diffusion models.},

abstract = {To test the novel hypothesis that the K+ efflux mediated by NMDA receptors might be regulated differently than the influx of Ca2+ and Na+ through the same receptor channels, NMDA receptor whole-cell currents carried concurrently or individually by Ca2+, Na+ and K+ were analysed in cultured mouse cortical neurons. In contrast to the NMDA inward current carried by Ca2+ and Na+, the NMDA receptor outward K+ current or NMDA-K current, recorded either in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+ and Na+, and at different or the same membrane potentials, showed much less sensitivity to alterations in intracellular Ca2+ concentration and underwent little rundown. In line with a selective regulation of the NMDA receptor K+ permeability, the ratio of the NMDA inward/outward currents decreased, and the reversal potential of composite NMDA currents recorded in physiological solutions shifted by -8.5 mV after repeated activation of NMDA receptors. Moreover, a depolarizing pre-pulse of a few seconds or a burst of brief depolarizing pulses selectively augmented the subsequent NMDA-K current, but not the NMDA inward current. On the other hand, a hyperpolarizing pre-pulse showed the opposite effect of reducing the NMDA-K current. The voltage- and activity-dependent regulation of the NMDA-K current did not require the existence of extracellular Ca2+ or Ca2+ influx; it was, however, affected by the duration of the pre-pulse and was subject to a time-dependent decay. The burst of excitatory activity revealed a lasting upregulation of the NMDA-K current even 5 s after termination of the pre-pulses. Our data reveal a selective regulation of the NMDA receptor K+ permeability and represent a novel model of voltage- and excitatory activity-dependent plasticity at the receptor level.},

abstract = {Astroglia from the postnatal cerebral cortex can be reprogrammed in vitro to generate neurons following forced expression of neurogenic transcription factors, thus opening new avenues towards a potential use of endogenous astroglia for brain repair. However, in previous attempts astroglia-derived neurons failed to establish functional synapses, a severe limitation towards functional neurogenesis. It remained therefore also unknown whether neurons derived from reprogrammed astroglia could be directed towards distinct neuronal subtype identities by selective expression of distinct neurogenic fate determinants. Here we show that strong and persistent expression of neurogenic fate determinants driven by silencing-resistant retroviral vectors instructs astroglia from the postnatal cortex in vitro to mature into fully functional, synapse-forming neurons. Importantly, the neurotransmitter fate choice of astroglia-derived neurons can be controlled by selective expression of distinct neurogenic transcription factors: forced expression of the dorsal telencephalic fate determinant neurogenin-2 (Neurog2) directs cortical astroglia to generate synapse-forming glutamatergic neurons; in contrast, the ventral telencephalic fate determinant Dlx2 induces a GABAergic identity, although the overall efficiency of Dlx2-mediated neuronal reprogramming is much lower compared to Neurog2, suggesting that cortical astroglia possess a higher competence to respond to the dorsal telencephalic fate determinant. Interestingly, however, reprogramming of astroglia towards the generation of GABAergic neurons was greatly facilitated when the astroglial cells were first expanded as neurosphere cells prior to transduction with Dlx2. Importantly, this approach of expansion under neurosphere conditions and subsequent reprogramming with distinct neurogenic transcription factors can also be extended to reactive astroglia isolated from the adult injured cerebral cortex, allowing for the selective generation of glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. These data provide evidence that cortical astroglia can undergo a conversion across cell lineages by forced expression of a single neurogenic transcription factor, stably generating fully differentiated neurons. Moreover, neuronal reprogramming of astroglia is not restricted to postnatal stages but can also be achieved from terminally differentiated astroglia of the adult cerebral cortex following injury-induced reactivation.},

An analysis using a simple linearization shows the systems dynamics when perturbed away from equilibrium. Results, based on previously published work by Karch and Schreiner are presented for a variety of parameters which provide different shapes of the tree and indicate a possible mechanism for "growing" the tree in specified directions. In addition the tree, through the use of local tagging has the ability to vary its size locally via a coupled set of conservation and reverting differential equations. {\textcopyright} 2010 IMACS.

abstract = {Recent epidemiological studies suggest that diabetes mellitus is a strong risk factor for Alzheimer disease. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, to investigate the pathophysiological interaction between these diseases, we generated animal models that reflect the pathologic conditions of both diseases. We crossed Alzheimer transgenic mice (APP23) with two types of diabetic mice (ob/ob and NSY mice), and analyzed their metabolic and brain pathology. The onset of diabetes exacerbated Alzheimer-like cognitive dysfunction without an increase in brain amyloid-beta burden in double-mutant (APP(+)-ob/ob) mice. Notably, APP(+)-ob/ob mice showed cerebrovascular inflammation and severe amyloid angiopathy. Conversely, the cross-bred mice showed an accelerated diabetic phenotype compared with ob/ob mice, suggesting that Alzheimer amyloid pathology could aggravate diabetes. Similarly, APP(+)-NSY fusion mice showed more severe glucose intolerance compared with diabetic NSY mice. Furthermore, high-fat diet feeding induced severe memory deficits in APP(+)-NSY mice without an increase in brain amyloid-beta load. Here, we created Alzheimer mouse models with early onset of cognitive dysfunction. Cerebrovascular changes and alteration in brain insulin signaling might play a pivotal role in this relationship. These findings could provide insights into this intensely debated association.},

abstract = {Quantification of nonlinear interactions between two nonstationary signals presents a computational challenge in different research fields, especially for assessments of physiological systems. Traditional approaches that are based on theories of stationary signals cannot resolve nonstationarity-related issues and, thus, cannot reliably assess nonlinear interactions in physiological systems. In this review we discuss a new technique "Multi-Modal Pressure Flow method (MMPF)" that utilizes Hilbert-Huang transformation to quantify dynamic cerebral autoregulation (CA) by studying interaction between nonstationary cerebral blood flow velocity (BFV) and blood pressure (BP). CA is an important mechanism responsible for controlling cerebral blood flow in responses to fluctuations in systemic BP within a few heart-beats. The influence of CA is traditionally assessed from the relationship between the well-pronounced systemic BP and BFV oscillations induced by clinical tests. Reliable noninvasive assessment of dynamic CA, however, remains a challenge in clinical and diagnostic medicine.In this brief review we: 1) present an overview of transfer function analysis (TFA) that is traditionally used to quantify CA; 2) describe the a MMPF method and its modifications; 3) introduce a newly developed automatic algorithm and engineering aspects of the improved MMPF method; and 4) review clinical applications of MMPF and its sensitivity for detection of CA abnormalities in clinical studies. The MMPF analysis decomposes complex nonstationary BP and BFV signals into multiple empirical modes adaptively so that the fluctuations caused by a specific physiologic process can be represented in a corresponding empirical mode. Using this technique, we recently showed that dynamic CA can be characterized by specific phase delays between the decomposed BP and BFV oscillations, and that the phase shifts are significantly reduced in hypertensive, diabetics and stroke subjects with impaired CA. In addition, the new technique enables reliable assessment of CA using both data collected during clinical test and spontaneous BP/BFV fluctuations during baseline resting conditions.},

However, advances made recently in the theory of generic excitable media suggest that an additional factor - the geometry of excitation wavefronts - may play an important role. In particular, impulse propagation strongly depends on the wavefront curvature on a small spatial scale. In the heart, excitation wavefronts have pronounced curvatures in several situations including waves initiated by small electrodes, waves emerging from narrow tissue structures, and waves propagating around the sharp edges of anatomical obstacles or around a zone of functional conduction block during spiral wave rotation. In this short review we consider the theoretical background relating impulse propagation to wavefront curvature and we estimate the role of wavefront curvature in electrical stimulation, formation of conduction block, and the dynamic behavior of spiral waves.},

Although the bulk of evidence supports receptor saturation, recent studies have started to reveal that alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors may not be saturated by a single vesicle of glutamate. Here, we address this question through a study of putative single synapses, made by hippocampal neurons in culture, that are identified by FM1-43 staining. An analysis of the sources of variability in the amplitudes of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents at single synapses reveals that this variability must arise presynaptically, from variations in the quantity of agonist released. Thus, glutamate receptors at hippocampal synapses are not generally saturated by quantal release.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a risk factor for dementia. It is unknown whether higher glucose levels increase the risk of dementia in people without diabetes.

METHODS: We used 35,264 clinical measurements of glucose levels and 10,208 measurements of glycated hemoglobin levels from 2067 participants without dementia to examine the relationship between glucose levels and the risk of dementia. Participants were from the Adult Changes in Thought study and included 839 men and 1228 women whose mean age at baseline was 76 years; 232 participants had diabetes, and 1835 did not. We fit Cox regression models, stratified according to diabetes status and adjusted for age, sex, study cohort, educational level, level of exercise, blood pressure, and status with respect to coronary and cerebrovascular diseases, atrial fibrillation, smoking, and treatment for hypertension.

RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 6.8 years, dementia developed in 524 participants (74 with diabetes and 450 without). Among participants without diabetes, higher average glucose levels within the preceding 5 years were related to an increased risk of dementia (P=0.01); with a glucose level of 115 mg per deciliter (6.4 mmol per liter) as compared with 100 mg per deciliter (5.5 mmol per liter), the adjusted hazard ratio for dementia was 1.18 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 1.33). Among participants with diabetes, higher average glucose levels were also related to an increased risk of dementia (P=0.002); with a glucose level of 190 mg per deciliter (10.5 mmol per liter) as compared with 160 mg per deciliter (8.9 mmol per liter), the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.40 (95{\%} CI, 1.12 to 1.76).

CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that higher glucose levels may be a risk factor for dementia, even among persons without diabetes. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.)},

abstract = {A system of differential equations describing stationary vasomotion is formulated. It incorporates the ionic transports, cell-membrane potential, muscle contraction of the vessel smooth muscle cells, and the mechanics of a thick-walled cylinder. It is shown that the interaction of Ca2+ and K+ fluxes mediated by voltage-gated and voltage-calcium-gated channels, respectively, brings about periodicity of those transports. This results on a time-periodic cytoplasmic calcium concentration, myosin light chains phosphorylation, and crossbridges formation with the attending muscle stress. The vessel's transmural pressure determines a hoop stress. The resultant hoop, elastic, and muscle stresses determine the rate of change of the vessel's diameter: vasomotion. The model results agree with the experimental observations. The sensitivity of the vasomotion's dependence on parameter values and its significance to experimental protocols are examined. Further, it is hypothesized that the dependence of calcium-channel openings on voltage is shifted by changes on transmural pressure. Thus, Harder's experimental results are reproduced, among them the decreasing of vessel diameter with increasing pressure. Those behaviors are associated with a pattern of change of the singularities of the system of equations describing the model. This suggests a functional relationship on the interactions of Ca2+ and K+ fluxes responsible for the myogenic response; it may not result from a single molecular mechanism. The model is constructed so that additional experimental information can be readily incorporated.},

Smooth muscle lacks the striations characteristic of cardiac and skeletal muscle. Layers of smooth muscle cells line the walls of various organs and tubes in the body, and the contractile function of smooth muscle is not under voluntary control. Contractile activity in smooth muscle is initiated by a Ca(2+)-calmodulin interaction to stimulate phosphorylation of the light chain of myosin. Ca(2+) sensitization of the contractile proteins is signaled by the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway to inhibit the dephosphorylation of the light chain by myosin phosphatase, thereby maintaining force generation. Removal of Ca(2+) from the cytosol and stimulation of myosin phosphatase initiate the process of smooth muscle relaxation.},

abstract = {Amyloidopathic disorders such as Alzheimers disease present symptomology years after the entrenchment of amyloidogenic imbalance. The pathologic (alpha)-helix -{\textgreater} (beta)-strand conversion of amyloid (beta)1-42 and amyloid (beta)1-40 peptides causes neuronal death in the vicinity. Symptomology often presents only after significant neurodegeneration. This thus warrants early detection of amyloidopathy in Alzheimers disease. Nonexistent modalities for direct identification and quantitation of soluble amyloid aggregates or (proto)fibrils forced us to undertake the development of a spectrophotometric technique to support ongoing drug design. Key requirements were independence from the need for extraneous staining, unambiguous amyloid aggregate detection, and minimal influence of interpretative errors. A Cytoviva instrument pivotal to this study captures scattering of light of visible-near-infrared (VNIR, 400-1000 nm) wavelengths within each pixel of the microscopic view field. We thus assembled a scattering intensity pattern database that provided "signatures" of amyloid aggregates. Comparison of unknown samples against this database enabled direct detection of amyloid aggregates. The technique was found useful for monitoring retinal and brain amyloidopathy in an ongoing preclinical anti-AD study, attesting to the techniques sensitivity and specificity. Interestingly, the technique was found applicable not just to excised brain tissue but also to isolated mouse retina. With the retina being heralded widely as a (diagnostic) extension of the CNS and retinal amyloidopathy occurring well before that in the brain, this development raises a possibility for the first direct retinal imaging diagnosis of early asymptomatic Alzheimers disease.},

abstract = {Cerebral blood flow adequate for brain activity and metabolic demand is maintained through the processes of autoregulation and neurovascular coupling. Astrocytes undoubtedly make an important contribution to these processes. The critical factors that determine the polarity of astrocytic response include: metabolites (e.g., arachidonic acid and its derivatives, lactate and oxygen concentrations), ions (H+, Ca2+ and K+), gliotransmitters (glutamate, Glu; gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA; d-serine; adenosine 5'-triphosphate, ATP and brain derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF), neuronal activity and vascular tone.Although the astrocytic contribution to neurovascular coupling has been intensively studied, a few important questions still remain, such as: (1) the modulatory function of astrocytes in tripartite synapses, including effects related to the strength of synaptic stimulation and the particular signaling pathway (astrocytic or neuronal) that becomes activated, (2) the significance of the vasoconstrictive reaction evoked by arachidonic acid metabolites (e.g., 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 20-HETE) under both physiological and pathological conditions, (3) the relationship between brain activity level and metabolic processes occurring in astrocytes, which is studied using neuroradiological techniques and (4) the astrocytic contribution to the neurovascular response under pathological conditions. Hence, the function of astrocytes in neurovascular coupling remains ambiguous. The function of astrocytes is beneficial and integrative in physiological conditions, but under definitive pathological conditions may become detrimental and involved in the development of diseases like ischemic stroke, arterial hypertension and Alzheimer's disease. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.},

abstract = {Spontaneous contraction and relaxation of arteries (and in some instances venules) has been termed vasomotion and has been observed in an extensive variety of tissues and species. However, its functions and underlying mechanisms are still under discussion. We demonstrate that in vivo spectrophotometry, measured simultaneously with extracellular recordings at the same locations in the visual thalamus of the cat, reveals vasomotion, measured as an oscillation (0.14 hz) in the recorded oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) signal, which appears spontaneously in the microcirculation and can last for periods of hours. During some non-oscillatory periods, maintained sensory stimulation evokes vasomotion lasting {\~{}}30s, resembling an adaptive vascular phenomenon. This oscillation in the oxyhaemoblobin signal is sensitive to pharmacological manipulation: it is inducible by chloralose anaesthesia and it can be temporarily blocked by systemic administration of adrenaline or acetylcholine (ACh). During these oscillatory periods, neurovascular coupling (i.e. the relationship between local neural activity and the rate of blood supply to that location) appears significantly altered. This raises important questions with regard to the interpretation of results from studies currently dependent upon a linear relationship between neural activity and blood flow, such as neuroimaging.},

abstract = {Recent studies reveal a novel role for hemoglobin as an allosterically regulated nitrite reductase that may mediate nitric oxide (NO)-dependent signaling along the physiological oxygen gradient. Nitrite reacts with deoxyhemoglobin in an allosteric reaction that generates NO and oxidizes deoxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin. NO then reacts at a nearly diffusion-limited rate with deoxyhemoglobin to form iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin, which to date has been considered a highly stable adduct and, thus, not a source of bioavailable NO. However, under physiological conditions of partial oxygen saturation, nitrite will also react with oxyhemoglobin, and although this complex autocatalytic reaction has been studied for a century, the interaction of the oxy- and deoxy-reactions and the effects on NO disposition have never been explored. We have now characterized the kinetics of hemoglobin oxidation and NO generation at a range of oxygen partial pressures and found that the deoxy-reaction runs in parallel with and partially inhibits the oxy-reaction. In fact, intermediates in the oxy-reaction oxidize the heme iron of iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin, a product of the deoxy-reaction, which releases NO from the iron-nitrosyl. This oxidative denitrosylation is particularly striking during cycles of hemoglobin deoxygenation and oxygenation in the presence of nitrite. These chemistries may contribute to the oxygen-dependent disposition of nitrite in red cells by limiting oxidative inactivation of nitrite by oxyhemoglobin, promoting nitrite reduction to NO by deoxyhemoglobin, and releasing free NO from iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin.},

abstract = {These studies were designed to determine the role of cerebral vascular endothelium in the "myogenic" depolarization and contraction observed in isolated cat middle cerebral arteries exposed to high transmural pressures. With intact endothelial cells we observed, on elevation of transmural pressure in cannulated isolated arteries, significant membrane depolarization, action potential generation, and reduction in internal diameter. After perfusion of the same vessels with collagenase and elastase for short periods of time to disrupt the endothelial layer, all previous responses to elevation of transmural pressure were no longer seen. Even though enzyme perfusion had no effect on membrane potential at "control" levels of transmural pressure, it abolished the pressure-dependent depolarization, action potential generation, and constriction. Furthermore, the contractile response to agonist stimulation was maintained after endothelial disruption via enzymes, showing that this method of endothelial disruption did not appreciably damage muscle cells. The data document a dependence of an intact endothelium in mediating the activation of isolated cat cerebral arteries in response to a changing transmural pressure. Thus, it is possible that the endothelial cell may serve as a transducer in the autoregulatory response to pressure.},

abstract = {Local blood flow is modulated in response to changing patterns of neuronal activity (Roy and Sherrington, 1890), a process termed neurovascular coupling. It has been proposed that the central cellular pathway driving this process is astrocytic Gq-GPCR-linked IP3R-dependent Ca(2+) signaling, though in vivo tests of this hypothesis are largely lacking. We examined the impact of astrocytic Gq-GPCR and IP3R-dependent Ca(2+) signaling on cortical blood flow in awake, lightly sedated, responsive mice using multiphoton laser-scanning microscopy and novel genetic tools that enable the selective manipulation of astrocytic signaling pathways in vivo. Selective stimulation of astrocytic Gq-GPCR cascades and downstream Ca(2+) signaling with the hM3Dq DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) designer receptor system was insufficient to modulate basal cortical blood flow. We found no evidence of observable astrocyte endfeet Ca(2+) elevations following physiological visual stimulation despite robust dilations of adjacent arterioles using cyto-GCaMP3 and Lck-GCaMP6s, the most sensitive Ca(2+) indicator available. Astrocytic Ca(2+) elevations could be evoked when inducing the startle response with unexpected air puffs. However, startle-induced astrocytic Ca(2+) signals did not precede corresponding startle-induced hemodynamic changes. Further, neurovascular coupling was intact in lightly sedated, responsive mice genetically lacking astrocytic IP3R-dependent Ca(2+) signaling (IP3R2 KO). These data demonstrate that astrocytic Gq-GPCR-linked IP3R-dependent Ca(2+) signaling does not mediate neurovascular coupling in visual cortex of awake, lightly sedated, responsive mice.},

abstract = {Vascular dysfunction has a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent data from brain imaging studies in humans and animal models suggest that cerebrovascular dysfunction may precede cognitive decline and onset of neurodegenerative changes in AD and AD models. Cerebral hypoperfusion and impaired amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) clearance across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may contribute to the onset and progression of dementia AD type. Decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) negatively affects the synthesis of proteins required for memory and learning, and may eventually lead to neuritic injury and neuronal death. Impaired clearance of Abeta from the brain by the cells of the neurovascular unit may lead to its accumulation on blood vessels and in brain parenchyma. The accumulation of Abeta on the cerebral blood vessels, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is associated with cognitive decline and is one of the hallmarks of AD pathology. CAA can severely disrupt the integrity of the blood vessel wall resulting in micro or macro intracerebral bleedings that exacerbates neurodegenerative process and inflammatory response and may lead to hemorrhagic stroke, respectively. Here, we review the role of the neurovascular unit and molecular mechanisms in vascular cells behind AD and CAA pathogenesis. First, we discuss apparent vascular changes, including the cerebral hypoperfusion and vascular degeneration that contribute to different stages of the disease process in AD individuals. We next discuss the role of the low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP), a key Abeta clearance receptor at the BBB and along the cerebrovascular system, whose expression is suppressed early in AD. We also discuss how brain-derived apolipoprotein E isoforms may influence Abeta clearance across the BBB. We then review the role of two interacting transcription factors, myocardin and serum response factor, in cerebral vascular cells in controlling CBF responses and LRP-mediated Abeta clearance. Finally, we discuss the role of microglia and perivascular macrophages in Abeta clearance from the brain. The data reviewed here support an essential role of neurovascular and BBB mechanisms in contributing to both, onset and progression of AD.},

abstract = {To explore non-synaptic mechanisms in paroxysmal discharges, we used a computer model of a simplified hippocampal pyramidal cell, surrounded by interstitial space and a "glial-endothelial" buffer system. Ion channels for Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Cl- ion antiport 3Na/Ca, and "active" ion pumps were represented in the neuron membrane. The glia had "leak" conductances and an ion pump. Fluxes, concentration changes and cell swelling were computed. The neuron was stimulated by injecting current. Afterdischarge (AD) followed stimulation if depolarization due to rising interstitial K+ concentration ([K+]o) activated persistent Na+ current (INa.P). AD was either simple or self-regenerating; either regular (tonic) or burst-type (clonic); and always self-limiting. Self-regenerating AD required sufficient INa.P to ensure re-excitation. Burst firing depended on activation of dendritic Ca2+ currents and Ca-dependent K+ current. Varying glial buffer function influenced [K+]o accumulation and afterdischarge duration. Variations in Na+ and K+ currents influenced the threshold and the duration of AD. The data show that high [K+]o and intrinsic membrane currents can produce the feedback of self-regenerating afterdischarges without synaptic input. The simulated discharge resembles neuron behavior during paroxysmal firing in living brain tissue.},

Unlike many other second-messenger mo!ecules, Ca 2÷ is required for life, yet prolonged high intracellular Ca 2÷ levels lead to cell death. Ca 2+ cannot be metabolized like other second-messenger molecules, so cells tightly regulate intracellular levels through numerous binding and specialized extrusion proteins. Normal intra- cellular Ca 2+ levels at - 100 nM are 20,000-fold lower than the 2 mM concentration found extracellularly. Scores of cellular proteins have been adapted to bind Ca 2+ tightly, in some cases simply to buffer or lower free Ca 2+ levels, and in others to trigger second-messenger pathways. The well-known basic elements in Ca 2÷ signal transduction have been extensively reviewed (Berridge, 1993; Carafoli, 1992; Clapham and Neer, 1993; Pozzan et al., 1994; Rhee, 1991; Tsien and Tsien, 1990).

abstract = {Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is the most commonly used noninvasive method for the assessment of vascular endothelial function; this assessment uses the magnitude of vasodilation according to reactive hyperemia. The physiological mechanism of vasodilation has been well studied; it was recently hypothesized that endothelial function can reversibly be estimated by computational analysis. This leads to more reliable information about cardiovascular risk factors. In this study, we first developed a mathematical model of vasodilation involving both intra- and inter-cellular pathways, which is constructed by integrating small-scale models based on known physiological mechanisms. We evaluated the proposed model with respect to several aspects: reproducibility of the FMD response; analysis of the relationship between FMD and endothelial function; and analysis of underlying mechanisms of low flowmediated constriction. We confirmed that the simulated results corresponded well with those observed physiologically. Therefore, the results of the present study show that the proposed model has sufficient capability to quantitatively analyze FMD. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {The integration of usable and flexible analysis support in modelling environments is a key success factor in Model-Driven Development. In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Scientists and clinicians employ a variety of optical imaging technologies to visualize and study the relationship between neurons, glial cells and blood vessels. In this paper, we present an overview of the current optical approaches used for the in vivo imaging of neurovascular coupling events in small animal models. These techniques include 2-photon microscopy, laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI), voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDi), functional photoacoustic microscopy (fPAM), functional near-infrared spectroscopy imaging (fNIRS) and multimodal imaging techniques. The basic principles of each technique are described in detail, followed by examples of current applications from cutting-edge studies of cerebral neurovascular coupling functions and metabolic. Moreover, we provide a glimpse of the possible ways in which these techniques might be translated to human studies for clinical investigations of pathophysiology and disease. In vivo optical imaging techniques continue to expand and evolve, allowing us to discover fundamental basis of neurovascular coupling roles in cerebral physiology and pathophysiology.},

abstract = {The unravelling of the polarized distribution of AQP4 in perivascular astrocytic endfeet has revitalized the interest in the role of astrocytes in controlling water and ion exchange at the brain-blood interface. The importance of the endfeet is based on the premise that they constitute a complete coverage of the vessel wall. Despite a number of studies based on different microscopic techniques this question has yet to be resolved. We have made an electron microscopic 3D reconstruction of perivascular endfeet in CA1 (stratum moleculare) of rat hippocampus. The endfeet interdigitate and overlap, leaving no slits between them. Only in a few sites do processes--tentatively classified as processes of microglia--extend through the perivascular glial sheath to establish direct contact with the endothelial basal lamina. In contrast to the endfoot covering of the endothelial tube, the endfoot covering of the pericyte is incomplete, allowing neuropil elements to touch the basal lamina that enwraps this type of cell. The 3D reconstruction also revealed large bundles of mitochondria in the endfoot processes that came in close apposition to the perivascular endfoot membrane. Our data support the idea that in pathophysiological conditions, the perivascular astrocytic covering may control the exchange of water and solutes between blood and brain and that free diffusion is limited to narrow clefts between overlapping endfeet.},

The spiral formation mechanism has thus been one of the major themes in the field of reaction- diffusion systems. Although the widely believed origin of spiral waves is the interaction of traveling waves, the heterogeneity of an excitable medium has recently been suggested as a probable cause.We suggest one possible origin of spiral waves using a Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction and a discretized FitzHugh-Nagumo model. The heterogeneity of the reaction field is shown to stochastically generate unidirectional sites, which can induce spiral waves. Furthermore, we found that the spiral wave vanished with only a small reduction in the excitability of the reaction field. These results reveal a gentle approach for controlling the appearance of a spiral wave on an excitable medium},

Dysregulation of intracellular calcium signalling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Increased intracellular calcium elicits the characteristic lesions of this disorder, including the accumulation of amyloid-$\beta$, the hyperphosphorylation of TAU and neuronal death. Conversely, neurodegeneration that is induced by amyloid-$\beta$ or TAU is probably mediated by changes in calcium homeostasis. Disruption of calcium regulation in the endoplasmic reticulum mediates the most significant signal-transduction cascades that are associated with Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, mutations that cause familial Alzheimer's disease have been linked to intracellular calcium signalling pathways. Destabilization of calcium signalling seems to be central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and targeting this process might be therapeutically beneficial.},

abstract = {Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is dually acylated by N-myristoylation and cysteine palmitoylation and resides in Golgi and caveolae membranes. N-Myristoylation is necessary for its membrane association and targeting into the Golgi complex of transfected cells whereas palmitoylation influences the targeting of eNOS into caveolae. However, the in vivo significance of palmitoylation, membrane association, and the corresponding caveolar localization of eNOS have not been shown. To further examine the nature of membrane association of palmitoylation-deficient forms of eNOS and to address the functional role(s) of palmitoylation in activation of eNOS in vivo, HEk 293 cells stably transfected with wild-type (WT) or palmitoylation-deficient mutants of eNOS were generated. Membrane association of the mutants was biochemically similar to that of the WT protein in terms of their resistance to high salt, high pH, and distribution between Triton X-114 detergent and aqueous phases, suggesting that other hydrophobic factor (s) in eNOS most likely contribute to its membrane association. Most importantly, palmitoylation-deficient mutants of eNOS released less NO from the cells than did WT enzyme, suggesting that palmitoylation plays an important role in determining the optimal release of NO from intact cells. The diminished release of NO from the palmitoylation-deficient mutants was not attributable to alterations in its catalytic properties as the purified mutant and WT enzymes were kinetically identical. Since palmitoylation is necessary for localization of eNOS in caveolae, our data suggest that such localization could regulate the frequency and magnitude of NO release in response to stimuli in vivo.},

Neurovascular coupling is so precise that it underlies neuroimaging techniques to map changes in neuronal activity. Therefore, understanding its basis is indispensable for the proper interpretation of imaging signals from functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography, routinely used in humans. Although neurovascular coupling mechanisms are not yet fully understood, considerable progress has been made over the last decade. In this review, we present recent knowledge from in vivo studies on the cortical cellular network involved in neurovascular coupling responses and the mediators implicated in these haemodynamic changes. Recent findings have emphasized the intricate interplay between both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in neurovascular coupling, together with an intermediary role of astrocytes, which are ideally positioned between neurons and microvessels. Finally, we describe latest findings on the alterations of neurovascular function encountered in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.},

With recognition of its roles in synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation, LTP; long-term depression, LTD) and elucidation of calcium-dependent, NMDAR-mediated activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), numerous molecular and pharmacological tools have been used to explore the physiology and pathological consequences for nitrergic signaling. In this review, the authors summarize the current understanding of this subtle signaling pathway, discuss the evidence for nitrergic modulation of ion channels and homeostatic modulation of intrinsic excitability, and speculate about the pathological consequences of spillover between different nitrergic compartments in contributing to aberrant signaling in neurodegenerative disorders. Accumulating evidence points to various ion channels and particularly voltage-gated potassium channels as signaling targets, whereby NO mediates activity-dependent control of intrinsic neuronal excitability; such changes could underlie broader mechanisms of synaptic plasticity across neuronal networks. In addition, the inability to constrain NO diffusion suggests that spillover from endothelium (eNOS) and/or immune compartments (iNOS) into the nervous system provides potential pathological sources of NO and where control failure in these other systems could have broader neurological implications. Abnormal NO signaling could therefore contribute to a variety of neurodegenerative pathologies such as stroke/excitotoxicity, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease.},

We found that a major source of variability in the captured light signal is a pervasive low-frequency (0.1-Hz) oscillation which apparently results from regional cerebral blood flow. This signal is present in brain parenchyma as well as the microvasculature and exhibits many characteristics of the low-frequency "vasomotion" signals observed in peripheral microcirculation. Concurrent measurements in brain with a laser Doppler flow meter contained an almost identical low-frequency signal. The presence of the 0.1-Hz oscillation in the cerebral microcirculation could underlie a portion of the previously described characteristics reported in reflected-light imaging studies. The prevalence of the oscillatory phenomena in the brain raises substantial temporal sampling issues for optical imaging and for other visualization techniques which depend on changes in regional cerebral blood dynamics, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging.},

The present study was designed to assess whether NO or prostacyclin also contributes to flow-dependent dilatation of conduit arteries in humans. Methods and Results Radial artery internal diameter (ID) was measured continuously in 16 healthy volunteers (age, 24{\{}+/-{\}}1 years) with a transcutaneous A-mode echo-tracking system coupled to a Doppler device for the measurement of radial blood flow. In 8 subjects, a catheter was inserted into the brachial artery for measurement of arterial pressure and infusion of the NO synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA; 8 {\{}micro{\}}mol/min for 7 minutes; infusion rate, 0.8 mL/min). Flow-dependent dilatation was evaluated before and after L-NMMA or aspirin as the response of the radial artery to an acute increase in flow (reactive hyperemia after a 3-minute cuff wrist occlusion). Under control conditions, release of the occlusion induced a marked increase in radial blood flow (from 24{\{}+/-{\}}3 to 73{\{}+/-{\}}11 mL/min; P{\textless}.01) followed by a delayed increase in radial diameter (flow-mediated dilatation; from 2.67{\{}+/-{\}}0.10 to 2.77{\{}+/-{\}}0.12 mm; P{\textless}.01) without any change in heart rate or arterial pressure. L-NMMA decreased basal forearm blood flow (from 24{\{}+/-{\}}3 to 13{\{}+/-{\}}3 mL/min; P{\textless}.05) without affecting basal radial artery diameter, heart rate, or arterial pressure, whereas aspirin (1 g PO) was without any hemodynamic effect. In the presence of L-NMMA, the peak flow response during hyperemia was not affected (76{\{}+/-{\}}12 mL/min), but the duration of the hyperemic response was markedly reduced, and the flow-dependent dilatation of the radial artery was abolished and converted to a vasoconstriction (from 2.62{\{}+/-{\}}0.11 to 2.55{\{}+/-{\}}0.11 mm; P{\textless}.01). In contrast, aspirin did not affect the hyperemic response nor the flow-dependent dilatation of the radial artery. Conclusions The present investigation demonstrates that NO, but not prostacyclin, is essential for flow-mediated dilatation of large human arteries. Hence, this response can be used as a test for the L-arginine/NO pathway in clinical studies.},

The conditional knockout was driven by the human glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter, gfa2. Experiments were performed in the hippocampus of anesthetized mice (postnatal days 17-24). Low level stimulation ({\textless}20 stimuli, 10 Hz) induced a moderated increase of [K(+)](o) ({\textless}2 mm increase) in both WT and cKO mice. However, cKO mice exhibited slower recovery of [K(+)](o) levels. With long-lasting stimulation (300 stimuli, 10 Hz), [K(+)](o) in WT and cKO mice displayed characteristic ceiling level ({\textgreater}2 mm increase) and recovery undershoot, with a more pronounced and prolonged undershoot in cKO mice. In addition, cKO glial cells were more depolarized, and, in contrast to those from WT mice, their membrane potential did not follow the stimulation-induced [K(+)](o) changes, reflecting the loss of their high potassium permeability. Our in vivo results support the role of K(ir)4.1 in setting the membrane potential of glial cells and its contribution to the glial potassium permeability. In addition, our data confirm the necessity of the K(ir)4.1 channel for an efficient uptake of K(+) by glial cells.},

abstract = {Neuronal activity in the brain is thought to be coupled to cerebral arterioles (functional hyperemia) through Ca2+ signals in astrocytes. Although functional hyperemia occurs rapidly, within seconds, such rapid signaling has not been demonstrated in situ, and Ca2+ measurements in parenchymal arterioles are still lacking. Using a laser scanning confocal microscope and fluorescence Ca2+ indicators, we provide the first evidence that in a brain slice preparation, increased neuronal activity by electrical stimulation (ES) is rapidly signaled, within seconds, to cerebral arterioles and is associated with astrocytic Ca2+ waves. Smooth muscle cells in parenchymal arterioles exhibited Ca2+ and diameter oscillations ("vasomotion") that were rapidly suppressed by ES. The neuronal-mediated Ca2+ rise in cortical astrocytes was dependent on intracellular (inositol trisphosphate [IP3]) and extracellular voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel sources. The Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin prevented the rise in astrocytic [Ca2+]i and the suppression of Ca2+ oscillations in parenchymal arterioles to ES, indicating that neuronal activity was necessary for both events. Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors in astrocytes significantly decreased the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations in parenchymal arterioles. This study supports the concept that astrocytic Ca2+ changes signal the cerebral microvasculature and indicate the novel concept that this communication occurs through the suppression of arteriolar [Ca2+]i oscillations and corresponding vasomotion.

abstract = {The relationship between local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) and local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) was studied in two groups of normal conscious rats. LCGU was measured by the [14C]deoxyglucose technique and LCBF by the [14C]iodoantipyrine technique. When the LCGU of 39 brain structures was correlated with their respective values of LCBF an excellent correlation (r = 0.96) was obtained between LCGU and LCBF, demonstrating a tight coupling at a local level. Chronic metabolic acidosis was induced in two other groups of rats by adding 0.35 M NH4Cl to the drinking water for 5-6 days. This resulted in a significant (P less than 0.01) reduction in overall cerebral glucose utilization (-29{\%}) and a nonsignificant reduction in overall cerebral blood flow (-8{\%}). This dissociation between the overall cerebral glucose utilization and blood flow during metabolic acidosis cannot be taken as an indicator of uncoupling because the values for LCGU were still well correlated (r = 0.95) with the values for LCBF, indicating a resetting of the coupling mechanism to a new level.},

abstract = {Shear stress stimulates nitric oxide (NO) production by phosphorylating endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) at Ser(1179) in a phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)- and protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent manner. The eNOS has additional potential phosphorylation sites, including Ser(116), Thr(497), and Ser(635). Here, we studied these potential phosphorylation sites in response to shear, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and 8-bromocAMP (8-BRcAMP) in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). All three stimuli induced phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser(635), which was consistently slower than that at Ser(1179). Thr(497) was rapidly dephosphorylated by 8-BRcAMP but not by shear and VEGF. None of the stimuli phosphorylated Ser(116). Whereas shear-stimulated Ser(635) phosphorylation was not affected by phosphoinositide-3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY-294002, it was blocked by either treating the cells with a PKA inhibitor H89 or infecting them with a recombinant adenovirus-expressing PKA inhibitor. These results suggest that shear stress stimulates eNOS by two different mechanisms: 1) PKA- and PI3K-dependent and 2) PKA-dependent but PI3K-independent pathways. Phosphorylation of Ser(635) may play an important role in chronic regulation of eNOS in response to mechanical and humoral stimuli.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) catalyzes the oxidation of one l-arginine guanidinium N atom to nitric oxide (NO). NOS consists of a heme domain linked to a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)/flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) reductase that shuttles electrons from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to the heme. This review summarizes various aspects of NOS structure and function derived from crystal structures coupled with a wealth of biochemical and biophysical data. This includes the binding of diatomic ligands, especially the product, NO, whose binding to the heme iron blocks enzyme activity. An unusual feature of NOS catalysis is the strict requirement for the essential cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (H 
                        4B). It now is generally agreed that H 
                        4B serves as an electron donor to the heme-oxy complex. The reason NOS may have recruited H 
                        4B as an electron transfer cofactor is to provide rapid coupled proton/electron transfer required for O 
                        2 activation. NOS is a highly regulated enzyme which is controlled by calmodulin (CaM) at the level of electron transfer within the FMN/FAD reductase and between the reductase and heme domains. Recent crystal structures provide a basis for developing models on the structural underpinnings of NOS regulation. In addition to the complex and fascinating functional and regulatory features of NOS, NOS is an important therapeutic target. Crystal structures have revealed the structural basis of isoform-selective inhibition by a group of dipeptide inhibitors which opens the way for structure-based inhibitor design. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

After baseline recordings (AD0) tests were repeated under 2x1.5 to 2x3mg (AD1) and 2x4.5 to 2x6mg (AD2) rivastigmine/d. Long-term effects were investigated under 6 months of medication (AD2L).

abstract = {Normal brain function requires proper supply of oxygen and glucose in a timely and local manner. This is achieved through an orchestrated intercellular communication between neurones, astrocytes and microvessels that results in a rapid and restricted increase in cerebral blood flow, a process known as neurovascular coupling. Astrocytic end-feet make close contacts with neuronal synapses and blood vessels and, given their ability to release vasoactive signals following neuronal activation, have been recognized as key intermediaries in the neurovascular response. Both dilating and constricting signals appear to be released from astrocytes upon increases in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, and both dilatation and constriction of brain vessels have been observed in previous studies. In this article, we discuss the various astrocyte-derived vasodilating and vasoconstricting signals, their interactions and effects on astrocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, and suggest the importance of the intrinsic properties of the latter cell type on the overall neurovascular response. We present a working model in which the rise in astrocytic Ca(2+) following neuronal activation leads not only to the rapid activation of calcium-activated K(+) channels in astrocytic end-feet, but also to their modulation by metabolites of the arachidonic acid pathway, which in general have been proposed to act on vascular smooth muscle cells rather than on astrocytes. We propose that this latter mechanism may in turn modulate K(+) signalling from astrocytes to smooth muscle cells, influencing the overall effects of the vasodilating and vasoconstricting signals released during neuronal activation.},

Proximal segments had stable membrane potentials with a mean value of -69 mV. The membrane potentials of distal segments were less negative and often unstable. 2. When the extracellular concentration of potassium ions [( K+]o) was increased proximal segments of arteriole were depolarized whereas distal ones were hyperpolarized. When [K+]o was decreased both proximal and distal segments were depolarized, the changes being more marked in proximal arterioles. 3. The membranes of proximal segments of arteriole displayed inward rectification at potentials near rest; inward rectification in distal segments of arteriole, when detected, was less pronounced. 4. The activation curve for inward rectification in proximal segments of arteriole was changed by changing the extracellular concentration of K+. A reduction in [K+]o caused the activation curve to move to such negative potentials that the inward rectifier no longer contributed to the resting conductance. 5. Increasing [K+]o changed the activation curve for inward rectification in distal segments of arteriole so that more K+ current flowed at potentials near resting. At the same time the membrane potential hyperpolarized. 6. The results are discussed in relation to autoregulatory changes which occur following changes in the K+ concentration of cerebrospinal fluid},

abstract = {The cloned BK channel alpha subunit from human myometrium was stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, either alone (CHOalpha cells) or in combination with the auxiliary beta subunit (CHOalpha+beta cells). We studied basic channel properties and the effects of cGMP- and cAMP-dependent protein kinases on the BK channel activity. Coexpression of alpha and beta subunits enhanced the Ca2+ and voltage sensitivity of the BK channel, and decreased the inhibitory potency of iberiotoxin. Blocking and stimulating effects on BK channel activity by charybdotoxin and nitric oxide, respectively, were independent of the beta subunit. The cGMP kinase Ialpha and cAMP kinase failed to affect BK channel activity in CHOalpha and CHOalpha+beta cells at different [Ca2+]i and voltages. In contrast, BK channels in freshly isolated myometrial cells from postmenopausal women responded to cAMP kinase and cGMP kinase with a fourfold and twofold decrease in their open probability (NPo), respectively. These effects could be reversed by alkaline phosphatase and remained unaffected by the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (100 nM). In 28{\%} of myometrial cells, however, cAMP and cGMP kinases increased NPo 2-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively. This stimulation was enhanced rather than reversed by alkaline phosphatase and was abolished by 100 nM okadaic acid. The results suggest that in stably transfected CHO cells the expressed BK channel is not regulated by cAMP kinase and cGMP kinase. However, in native myometrial cells stimulatory and inhibitory regulation of BK channels by cAMP kinase and cGMP kinase was observed, suggesting that channel regulation by the protein kinases requires factors that are not provided by CHO cells. Alternatively, failure of regulation may have been due to the primary structure of the myometrial BK channel protein used in this study.},

abstract = {The calcium signaling plays a vital role in flow-dependent vascular endothelial cell (VEC) physiology. Variations in fluid shear stress and ATP concentration in blood vessels can activate dynamic responses of cytosolic-free [Formula: see text] through various calcium channels on the plasma membrane. In this paper, a novel dynamic model has been proposed for transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 [Formula: see text]-mediated intracellular calcium dynamics in VECs induced by fluid shear stress and ATP. Our model includes [Formula: see text] signaling pathways through P2Y receptors and [Formula: see text] channels (indirect mechanism) and captures the roles of the [Formula: see text] compound channels in VEC [Formula: see text] signaling in response to fluid shear stress (direct mechanism). In particular, it takes into account that the [Formula: see text] compound channels are regulated by intracellular [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] concentrations. The simulation studies have demonstrated that the dynamic responses of calcium concentration produced by the proposed model correlate well with the existing experimental observations. We also conclude from the simulation studies that endogenously released ATP may play an insignificant role in the process of intracellular [Formula: see text] response to shear stress.},

abstract = {P2X4 receptors are adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-gated cation channels present on the plasma membrane (PM) and also within intracellular compartments such as vesicles, vacuoles, lamellar bodies (LBs), and lysosomes. P2X4 receptors in microglia are up-regulated in epilepsy and in neuropathic pain; that is to say, their total and/or PM expression levels increase. However, the mechanisms underlying up-regulation of microglial P2X4 receptors remain unclear, in part because it has not been possible to image P2X4 receptor distribution within, or trafficking between, cellular compartments. Here, we report the generation of pH-sensitive fluorescently tagged P2X4 receptors that permit evaluations of cell surface and total receptor pools. Capitalizing on information gained from zebrafish P2X4.1 crystal structures, we designed a series of mouse P2X4 constructs in which a pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein, superecliptic pHluorin (pHluorin), was inserted into nonconserved regions located within flexible loops of the P2X4 receptor extracellular domain. One of these constructs, in which pHluorin was inserted after lysine 122 (P2X4-pHluorin123), functioned like wild-type P2X4 in terms of its peak ATP-evoked responses, macroscopic kinetics, calcium flux, current-voltage relationship, and sensitivity to ATP. P2X4-pHluorin123 also showed pH-dependent fluorescence changes, and was robustly expressed on the membrane and within intracellular compartments. P2X4-pHluorin123 identified cell surface and intracellular fractions of receptors in HEK-293 cells, hippocampal neurons, C8-B4 microglia, and alveolar type II (ATII) cells. Furthermore, it showed that the subcellular fractions of P2X4-pHluorin123 receptors were cell and compartment specific, for example, being larger in hippocampal neuron somata than in C8-B4 cell somata, and larger in C8-B4 microglial processes than in their somata. In ATII cells, P2X4-pHluorin123 showed that P2X4 receptors were secreted onto the PM when LBs undergo exocytosis. Finally, the use of P2X4-pHluorin123 showed that the modulator ivermectin did not increase the PM fraction of P2X4 receptors and acted allosterically to potentiate P2X4 receptor responses. Collectively, our data suggest that P2X4-pHluorin123 represents a useful optical probe to quantitatively explore P2X4 receptor distribution, trafficking, and up-regulation.},

abstract = {The link between atherosclerosis and regions of disturbed flow and low wall shear stress is now firmly established, but the causal mechanisms underlying the link are not yet understood. It is now recognised that the endothelium is not simply a passive barrier between the blood and the vessel wall, but plays an active role in maintaining vascular homeostasis and participates in the onset of atherosclerosis. Calcium signalling is one of the principal intracellular signalling mechanisms by which endothelial cells (EC) respond to external stimuli, such as fluid shear stress and ligand binding. Previous studies have separately modelled mass transport of chemical species in the bloodstream and calcium dynamics in EC via the inositol trisphosphate (IP3) signalling pathway. We review existing models of these two phenomena, before going on to integrate the two components to provide an inclusive new model for the calcium response of the endothelium in an arbitrary vessel geometry. This enables the combined effects of fluid flow and biochemical stimulation on EC to be investigated and is the first time spatially varying, physiological fluid flow-related environmental factors have been combined with intracellular signalling in a mathematical model. Model results show that low endothelial calcium levels in the area of disturbed flow at an arterial widening may be one contributing factor to the onset of vascular disease. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In vitro, alpha-adrenoreceptor stimulation of rat mesenteric small arteries often leads to a rhythmic change in wall tension, i.e., vasomotion. Within the individual smooth muscle cells of the vascular wall, vasomotion is often preceded by a period of asynchronous calcium waves. Abruptly, these low-frequency waves may transform into high-frequency whole cell calcium oscillations. Simultaneously, multiple cells synchronize, leading to rhythmic generation of tension. We present a mathematical model of vascular smooth muscle cells that aims at characterizing this sudden transition. Simulations show calcium waves sweeping through the cytoplasm when the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is stimulated to release calcium. A rise in cGMP leads to the experimentally observed transition from waves to whole cell calcium oscillations. At the same time, membrane potential starts to oscillate and the frequency approximately doubles. In this transition, the simulated results point to a key role for a recently discovered cGMP-sensitive calcium-dependent chloride channel. This channel depolarizes the membrane in response to calcium released from the SR. In turn, depolarization causes a uniform opening of L-type calcium channels on the cell surface, stimulating a synchronized release of SR calcium and inducing the shift from waves to whole cell oscillations. The effect of the channel is therefore to couple the processes of the SR with those of the membrane. We hypothesize that the shift in oscillatory mode and the associated onset of oscillations in membrane potential within the individual cell may underlie sudden intercellular synchronization and the appearance of vasomotion.},

abstract = {Human blood cells can be separated using an apparatus described by Hanning and co-workers (Model FF4 Desaga Heidelberg). The method of free flow preparative electrophoresis uses a specific property of blood cells when subjected to an electric field: their electrophoretic mobility. Three regions of migration can be defined: --a high mobility region (HMR); --a low mobility region (LMR) and --an intermediate mobility region (IMR). After the electrophoretic migration, the various cell fractions are identified. If human leucocytes are subjected to an electric field (40 volts/cm) it is possible to isolate several populations which differ by their membranes electric charge. The repartition of the neutrophiles granulocytes is twofold: --one fraction of high mobility (HMR) and --one fraction of low mobility (LMR). The meaning of these two populations is being discussed. Between these teo fractions is located the lymphocyte fraction which is represented by a single peak of intermediate mobility (IMR). Eosinophiles and monocytes are concentrated in low mobility fraction (LMR). With appropriate migration parameters (80 volts/cm, various component buffers) it is possible to obtain from lymphocytes, purified by density gradient, an electrophoretic separation of T and B lymphocytes population. Histograms obtained from quantitative measures (on collected cell fractions) show an unimodal distribution. When separated cells are characterized by three membranes markers (E. Rosettes, EAC Rosettes and surface immunoglobulins) the electrophoretic heterogeneity of B and T cells is then demonstrated. With E Rosettes (T cells) the majority of T lymphocytes is distributed in HMR and IMR. With EAC Rosettes and membrane immunofluorescence (B cells markers) the majority of B lymphocytes is found in the LMR. Thus an important enrichment of T and B sub-population is obtained, but contamination from one another still remains too important. More selective methods should lead to an improvement of this cell separation.},

abstract = {Despite striking advances in functional brain imaging, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the signals detected by these techniques are still largely unknown. The basic physiological principle of functional imaging is represented by the tight coupling existing between neuronal activity and the associated local increase in both blood flow and energy metabolism. Positron emission tomography (PET) signals detect blood flow, oxygen consumption and glucose use associated with neuronal activity; the degree of blood oxygenation is currently thought to contribute to the signal detected with functional magnetic resonance imaging, while magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) identifies the spatio-temporal pattern of the activity-dependent appearance of certain metabolic intermediates such as glucose or lactate. Recent studies, including those of neurotransmitter-regulated metabolic fluxes in purified preparations and analyses of the cellular localization of enzymes and transporters involved in energy metabolism, as well as in vivo microdialysis and MRS approaches have identified the neurotransmitter glutamate and astrocytes, a specific type of glial cell, as pivotal elements in the coupling of synaptic activity with energy metabolism. Astrocytes are ideally positioned to sense increases in synaptic activity and to couple them with energy metabolism. Indeed they possess specialized processes that cover the surface of intraparenchymal capillaries, suggesting that astrocytes may be a likely site of prevalent glucose uptake. Other astrocyte processes are wrapped around synaptic contacts which possess receptors and reuptake sites for neurotransmitters. Glutamate stimulates glucose uptake into astrocytes. This effect is mediated by specific glutamate transporters present on these cells. The activity of these transporters, which is tightly coupled to the synaptic release of glutamate and operates the clearance of glutamate from the extracellular space, is driven by the electrochemical gradient of Na+. This Na(+)-dependent uptake of glutamate into astrocytes triggers a cascade of molecular events involving the Na+/K(+)-ATPase leading to the glycolytic processing of glucose and the release of lactate by astrocytes. The stoichiometry of this process is such that for one glutamate molecule taken up with three Na+ ions, one glucose molecule enters an astrocyte, two ATP molecules are produced through aerobic glycolysis and two lactate molecules are released. Within the astrocyte, one ATP molecule fuels one 'turn of the pump' while the other provides the energy needed to convert glutamate to glutamine by glutamine synthase. Evidence has been accumulated from structural as well as functional studies indicating that, under aerobic conditions, lactate may be the preferred energy substrate of activated neurons. Indeed, in the presence of oxygen, lactate is converted to pyruvate, which can be processed through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the associated oxidative phosphorylation, to yield 17 ATP molecules per lactate molecule. These data suggest that during activation the brain may transiently resort to aerobic glycolysis occurring in astrocytes, followed by the oxidation of lactate by neurons. The proposed model provides a direct mechanism to couple synaptic activity with glucose use and is consistent with the notion that the signals detected during physiological activation with 18F-deoxyglucose (DG)-PET may reflect predominantly uptake of the tracer into astrocytes. This conclusion does not question the validity of the 2-DG-based techniques, rather it provides a cellular and molecular basis for these functional brain imaging techniques.},

abstract = {An integrative, systems approach to the modelling of brain energy metabolism is presented. Mechanisms such as glutamate cycling between neurons and astrocytes and glycogen storage in astrocytes have been implemented. A unique feature of the model is its calibration using in vivo data of brain glucose and lactate from freely moving rats under various stimuli. The model has been used to perform simulated perturbation experiments that show that glycogen breakdown in astrocytes is significantly activated during sensory (tail pinch) stimulation. This mechanism provides an additional input of energy substrate during high consumption phases. By way of validation, data from the perfusion of 50 microM propranolol in the rat brain was compared with the model outputs. Propranolol affects the glucose dynamics during stimulation, and this was accurately reproduced in the model by a reduction in the glycogen breakdown in astrocytes. The model's predictive capacity was verified by using data from a sensory stimulation (restraint) that was not used for model calibration. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the model parameters, this showed that the control of energy metabolism and transport processes are critical in the metabolic behaviour of cerebral tissue.},

If all the positive entries are log-convex functions, the paper shows that the associated Perron root is log-convex on the parameter set and the l1-norm of the solution is log-convex on the feasibility set. These results imply that the feasibility set is a convex set regardless whether the l1-norm of the solution is bounded by some positive real number or not.

abstract = {Astrocytes are critical regulators of neural and neurovascular network communication. Potassium transport is a central mechanism behind their many functions. Astrocytes encircle synapses with their distal processes, which express two potassium pumps (Na-K and NKCC) and an inward rectifying potassium channel (Kir), whereas the vessel-adjacent endfeet express Kir and BK potassium channels. We provide a detailed model of potassium flow throughout the neurovascular unit (synaptic region, astrocytes, and arteriole) for the cortex of the young brain. Our model reproduces several phenomena observed experimentally: functional hyperemia, in which neural activity triggers astrocytic potassium release at the perivascular endfoot, inducing arteriole dilation; K+ undershoot in the synaptic space after periods of neural activity; neurally induced astrocyte hyperpolarization during Kir blockade. Our results suggest that the dynamics of the vascular response during functional hyperemia are governed by astrocytic Kir for the fast onset and astrocytic BK for maintaining dilation. The model supports the hypothesis that K+ undershoot is caused by excessive astrocytic uptake through Na-K and NKCC pumps, whereas the effect is balanced by Kir. We address parametric uncertainty using high-dimensional stochastic sensitivity analysis and identify possible model limitations. ?? 2013 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {A mathematical account is given of the processes governing the time courses of calcium ions (Ca2+), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in single cells following the application of external agonist to metabotropic receptors. A model is constructed that incorporates the regulation of metabotropic receptor activity, the G-protein cascade and the Ca2+ dynamics in the cytosol. It is subsequently used to reproduce observations on the extent of desensitization and sequestration of the P2Y2 receptor following its activation by uridine triphosphate (UTP). The theory predicts the dependence on agonist concentration of the change in the number of receptors in the membrane as well as the time course of disappearance of receptors from the plasmalemma, upon exposure to agonist. In addition, the extent of activation and desensitization of the receptor, using the calcium transients in cells initiated by exposure to agonist, is also predicted. Model predictions show the significance of membrane PIP2 depletion and resupply on the time course of IP3 and Ca2+ levels. Results of the modelling also reveal the importance of receptor recycling and PIP2 resupply for maintaining Ca2+ and IP3 levels during sustained application of agonist. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Endothelial cells have common as well as specialized roles in different tissues and organs; as such, the abundant endothelial cells in the corpus luteum ({\textgreater} 50{\%} of total cell population) could have unique activities necessary for luteal function. Our objective was to establish a method for isolating a pure population of endothelial cells from the primate corpus luteum and to determine the basic conditions for in vitro culture. Corpora lutea collected from rhesus monkeys throughout the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle were minced and enzymatically dispersed into single cell suspensions. Endothelial cells were isolated from the remaining cells (i.e., steroidogenic, fibroblastic, etc.) utilizing magnetic beads labeled with a lectin, Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1 (UEA-1), which binds a sugar found only on primate endothelial cells. After exposure to a magnetic field, UEA-1-negative (-) cells were decanted from the pelleted UEA-1-positive (+) cells; to remove beads from the UEA-1 (+) cells, excess sugar was applied. After optimization of the bead-to-cell ratio, the UEA-1 (+) group contained a population of cells 8-12 microns in diameter (typical endothelial cell size) and {\textless} 1{\%} steroidogenic cells. UEA-1 (-) cells were larger (15-35 microns) and stained histochemically for the steroidogenic marker, 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that {\textgreater} 93{\%} of all cells in the UEA-1 (+) group stained positive for the specific endothelial cell marker, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1. Cultured UEA-1 (+) cells produced low levels of progesterone and were unresponsive to hCG (100 ng/ml). In contrast, cultured UEA-1 (-) and mixed (unsorted) cells produced high basal levels of progesterone and exhibited a {\textgreater} 3-fold increase in response to hCG treatment. Preliminary experiments comparing different culture media and matrices demonstrated that 1) cell proliferation was unaffected by type of medium (i.e., Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium [DMEM]/ F12 or McCoy's 5A); 2) the presence of serum was essential in the absence of added growth factors, and 3) extracellular matrix had a profound effect on proliferation. UEA-1 (+) cells exhibited a dose-dependent increase in cell proliferation in response to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the presence and absence of fetal calf serum. In the absence of serum, VEGF stimulated proliferation of UEA-1 (+) cells plated on fibronectin but not collagen I, whereas in the presence of 10{\%} fetal calf serum, both matrices supported VEGF-induced mitogenesis. These studies provide for the first time an efficient, reliable method for isolating primate luteal endothelial cells and describe in vitro culture conditions for subsequent studies examining luteal endothelial cell function and regulation.},

Expression of eNOS is altered in many types of cardiovascular disease, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes and hypertension. The ubiquitous chaperone heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) associates with NOS and is important for its proper folding and function. Current studies point toward a therapeutic potential by modulating hsp90-NOS association in various vascular diseases. Here we review the transcriptional regulation of endothelial NOS and factors affecting eNOS activity and function, as well as the important vascular pathologies associated with altered NOS function, focusing on the regulatory role of hsp90 and other factors in NO-associated pathogenesis of these diseases. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {1. A new form of synaptic depression of excitatory synaptic transmission was observed when making voltage-clamp recordings from large presynaptic terminals, the calyces of Held and postsynaptic cells, the principal cells of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), in slices of the rat auditory brainstem. 2. A short (100 ms) depolarization of the postsynaptic cell to 0 mV reduced the amplitude of the EPSCs by 35 +/- 5 {\%} (n = 7), measured at 10 ms following the depolarization. Recovery occurred within 0.5 s. 3. The reduction of the EPSCs was most probably due to reduced presynaptic calcium influx, since postsynaptic depolarization reduced presynaptic calcium or barium currents. Conversely, presynaptic depolarization also reduced postsynaptic calcium or barium influx, under conditions where transmitter release was minimal. 4. The calcium currents and the postsynaptic depolarization-induced suppression of synaptic transmission recovered with a similar time course, suggesting that this form of synaptic depression was, most probably, due to depletion of Ca2+ in the synaptic cleft. 5. We conclude that when the Ca2+ influx into the pre- or postsynaptic cell is large, extracellular Ca2+ is depleted. Under these conditions, the Ca2+ concentration in the synaptic cleft is a sensitive indicator of the level of synaptic activity. However, the synaptic cleft is less sensitive to Ca2+ depletion than predicted from its estimated volume.},

abstract = {Following stimulation of NMDA receptors, neurons transiently synthesize nitric oxide (NO) in a calcium/calmodulin-dependent manner through the activation of neuronal NO synthase. Nitric oxide acts as a messenger, activating soluble guanylyl cyclase and participating in the transduction signalling pathways involving cyclic GMP. Nitric oxide also binds to cytochrome c oxidase, and is able to inhibit cell respiration in a process that is reversible and in competition with oxygen. This action can also lead to the release of superoxide anion from the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Here, we discuss recent evidence that this mitochondrial interaction represents a molecular switch for cell signalling pathways involved in the control of physiological functions. These include superoxide- or oxygen-dependent modulation of gene transcription, calcium-dependent cell signalling responses, changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential or AMP-activated protein kinase-dependent control of glycolysis. In pathophysiological conditions, such as brain ischaemia or neurological disorders, NO is formed excessively by NMDA receptor over-activation in neurons, or by inducible NO synthase from neighbouring glia (microglial cells and astrocytes). Elevated NO concentrations can then interact with superoxide anion, generated by the mitochondria or by other mechanisms, leading to the formation of the powerful oxidant species peroxynitrite. During pathological conditions activation of the NAD(+)-consuming enzyme poly(APD-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is also a likely mechanism for NO-mediated energy failure and neurotoxicity. Activation of PARP-1 is, however, a repair process, which in milder forms of oxidative stress protects neurons from death. Thus, whilst NO plays a physiological role in neuronal cell signalling, its over-production may cause neuronal energy compromise leading to neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Smooth muscle cell (SMC) contraction is controlled by the Ca2+ and
Rho kinase signalling pathways. While the SMC Rho kinase system seems
to be reasonably constant, there is enormous variation with regard
to the mechanisms responsible for generating Ca2+ signals. One way
of dealing with this diversity is to consider how this system has
been adapted to control different SMC functions. Phasic SMCs (vas
deferens, uterus and bladder) rely on membrane depolarization to
drive Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. This depolarization
can be induced by neurotransmitters or through the operation of a
membrane oscillator. Many tonic SMCs (vascular, airway and corpus
cavernosum) are driven by a cytosolic Ca2+ oscillator that generates
periodic pulses of Ca2+. A similar oscillator is present in pacemaker
cells such as the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) and atypical
SMCs that control other tonic SMCs (gastrointestinal, urethra, ureter).
The changes in membrane potential induced by these cytosolic oscillators
does not drive contraction directly but it functions to couple together
individual oscillators to provide the synchronization that is a characteristic
feature of many tonic SMCs.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Lung inflammation is present in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and interstitial lung disease (ILD), but the mechanisms linking inflammatory and fibrotic processes in ILD are unknown. Our aim was to investigate whether alveolar inflammation, reflected by increased alveolar concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (C(A)NO), is related to the ability of serum from patients with SSc to induce pulmonary fibroblast proliferation (PFP) and myofibroblast conversion. METHODS: C(A)NO was measured in all subjects (37 patients with SSc and 10 healthy controls) whose sera were used to stimulate PFP (assessed by BrdU labeling index) and myofibroblast conversion (detected by alpha-smooth muscle actin expression). The PFP index in patients with SSc was compared to control values, and between patients with SSc who had elevated ({\textgreater} 4.3 ppb) and normal ({\textless}or= 4.3 ppb) C(A)NO values. RESULTS: Both C(A)NO and the PFP index were significantly greater in patients with SSc compared to controls. In patients with SSc, the PFP index was directly related to C(A)NO levels (r = 0.48; p = 0.002). The median PFP index was significantly higher in patients with SSc who had elevated C(A)NO ({\textgreater} 4.3 ppb; n = 25, median 1.1, range 0.98-1.23) than in patients with SSc who had normal C(A)NO ({\textless}or= 4.3 ppb; n = 12, median 0.93, range 0.82-1.08; p = 0.01). Similarly, myofibroblast conversion induced by SSc serum was significantly greater in patients with C(A)NO {\textgreater} 4.3 ppb than in patients whose C(A)NO was {\textless}or= 4.3 ppb (p {\textless} 0.001) and controls (p {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: Alveolar inflammation reflected by increased nitric oxide production was related to serum-induced PFP and myofibroblast conversion, linking the active alveolitis process to cell proliferation and lung fibrosis in patients with SSc.},

abstract = {While a range of cellular mechanisms have been proposed to underlie control of neurovascular coupling, a comprehensive, reconciliatory model has yet to be determined. To fit with such a model, it is essential that candidate mechanisms exhibit reaction times, spatial ranges, and speeds of propagation that are consistent with the vascular manifestations of the 'hemodynamic response'. Understanding these vascular dynamics is therefore a critical step towards developing a robust model of neurovascular coupling. In this study, we utilize high-speed optical imaging of exposed rodent somatosensory cortex to explore and characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface vessels during functional hyperemia. Our high-speed, high-resolution optical imaging approach allows us to study the hemodynamic response independently in individual vessels, and in discrete regions of the parenchyma with enough resolution to precisely characterize subtle spatial and temporal features of the response. Specifically, we explore when and where the first hemodynamic changes occur in response to stimuli, the direction and speed at which these changes propagate in arterioles and regions of the parenchyma, and the relative timing at which each of these compartments returns to its original baseline state. From these results, we are able to conclude that the hemodynamic response appears to initiate in the parenchyma and then spreads rapidly to surface arterioles. Following the initial onset we find evidence that the response spreads spatially outwards via the dilation of targeted arterioles. This propagation of vasodilation is independent of the direction of blood flow within each arteriole. We also find evidence of a decay phase that acts with a more uniform spatial dependence, rather than along targeted vessels, causing the periphery of the responding region to return to baseline first. We hypothesize that different underlying cellular mechanisms/signaling pathways are responsible for the response initiation and the response decay. Our results advance the fundamental understanding of the hemodynamic response, as well as our ability to evaluate potential cellular mechanisms for their involvement in neurovascular coupling.},

abstract = {Previous studies suggested that amyloid ?? (A??)-induced disruption of astrocytic Ca2+ signalling and oxidative stress play a major role in the progression towards neuronal and glial death in Alzheimer's disease. We have recently demonstrated that Ca2+-permeable TRPV4 channels are highly expressed in rat hippocampal astrocytes and are involved in oxidative stress-induced cell damage. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that TRPV4 channels also contribute to hippocampal damage evoked by A??. Synthetic A??40 evoked cell death in hippocampal slice cultures in a concentration (0-20??M) and time (12-48h) dependent manner, after cultures were preconditioned with sublethal concentration of buthionine sulfoximine (1.5??M) which enhanced endogenous ROS production. As demonstrated by propidium iodide fluorescence, damage was observed in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus and to a smaller degree in pyramidal neurons of the CA1-CA3 region, as well as in glia cells mainly at the edge of the slice. Immunocytochemistry revealed an altered pattern of TRPV4 and GFAP protein expression, and reactive astrogliosis surrounding pyramidal CA1-CA3 neurons. Neuronal and astrocytic damage was attenuated by the antioxidant Trolox, TRPV4 channel blockers Gd3+ and ruthenium red (RR), and a specific inhibitor of the redox and Ca2+-sensitive phospholipase A2 enzyme (MAFP). In disassociated co-cultures of hippocampal neurons and astrocytes without BSO preconditioning, A??40 evoked pronounced neuronal damage, enhanced the expression of TRPV4 and GFAP proteins (indicative of reactive astrogliosis), and increased intracellular free Ca2+ concentration in astrocytes. The latter effect was attenuated by RR and in Ca2+-free media. These data show that A??40 can activate astrocytic TRPV4 channels in the hippocampus, leading to neuronal and astrocytic damage in a Ca2+ and oxidative stress-dependent manner. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The electrophysiological properties and functional role of GABAergic signal transmission from neurons to the gap junction-coupled astrocytic network are still unclear. GABA-induced astrocytic Cl⁻ flux has been hypothesized to affect the driving force for GABAergic transmission by modulating [Cl⁻]o. Thus, revealing the properties of GABA-mediated astrocytic responses will deepen our understanding of GABAergic signal transmission. Here, we analysed the Cl⁻ dynamics of neurons and astrocytes in CA1 hippocampal GABAergic tripartite synapses, using Cl⁻ imaging during GABA application, and whole cell recordings from interneuron-astrocyte pairs in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare. Astrocytic [Cl⁻]i was adjusted to physiological conditions (40 mm). Although GABA application evoked bidirectional Cl⁻ flux via GABAA receptors and mouse GABA transporter 4 (mGAT4) in CA1 astrocytes, a train of interneuron firing induced only GABAA receptor-mediated inward currents in an adjacent astrocyte. A GAT1 inhibitor increased the interneuron firing-induced currents and induced bicuculline-insensitive, mGAT4 inhibitor-sensitive currents, suggesting that synaptic spillover of GABA predominantly induced the astrocytic Cl⁻ efflux because GABAA receptors are localized near the synaptic clefts. This GABA-induced Cl⁻ efflux was accompanied by Cl⁻ siphoning via the gap junctions of the astrocytic network because gap junction inhibitors significantly reduced the interneuron firing-induced currents. Thus, Cl⁻ efflux from astrocytes is homeostatically maintained within astrocytic networks. A gap junction inhibitor enhanced the activity-dependent depolarizing shifts of reversal potential of neuronal IPSCs evoked by repetitive stimulation to GABAergic synapses. These results suggest that Cl⁻ conductance within the astrocytic network may contribute to maintaining GABAergic synaptic transmission by regulating [Cl⁻]o.},

abstract = {Because regional blood flow increases in association with the increased metabolic demand generated by localized increases in neural activity, functional imaging researchers often assume that changes in blood flow are an accurate read-out of changes in underlying neural activity. An understanding of the mechanisms that link changes in neural activity to changes in blood flow is crucial for assessing the validity of this assumption, and for understanding the processes that can go wrong during disease states such as ischaemic stroke. Many studies have investigated the mechanisms of neurovascular regulation in arterioles but other evidence suggests that blood flow regulation can also occur in capillaries, because of the presence of contractile cells, pericytes, on the capillary wall. Here we review the evidence that pericytes can modulate capillary diameter in response to neuronal activity and assess the likely importance of neurovascular regulation at the capillary level for functional imaging experiments. We also discuss evidence suggesting that pericytes are particularly sensitive to damage during pathological insults such as ischaemia, Alzheimer's disease and diabetic retinopathy, and consider the potential impact that pericyte dysfunction might have on the development of therapeutic interventions and on the interpretation of functional imaging data in these disorders.},

We aim at providing the pros and cons to the following statements that, depending on the nature of the afferent input to the neocortex, (i) different neuronal or astroglial messengers, likely acting in sequence, mediate the hemodynamic changes, (ii) some recruited neurons release messengers that directly alter blood vessel tone, (iii) others act by modulating neuronal and astroglial activity, and (iv) astrocytes act as intermediaries for both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. We will stress that a given afferent signal activates a precise neuronal circuitry that determines the mediators of the hemodynamic response as well as the level of interaction with surrounding astrocytes.},

ICWs are triggered by a variety of stimuli and involve the release of Ca(2+) from internal stores. The propagation of ICWs predominately involves cell communication with internal messengers moving via gap junctions or extracellular messengers mediating paracrine signaling. ICWs appear to be important in both normal physiology as well as pathophysiological processes in a variety of organs and tissues including brain, liver, retina, cochlea, and vascular tissue.

Whisker deflection (60 s) increased rCBF by 18 +/- 3{\%}. NO synthase (NOS) inhibition by N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA; topically) reduced the rCBF response to 9 +/- 4{\%} and resting rCBF to 80 +/- 8{\%}. NO donors [S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP; 50 microM), 3-morpholinosydnonimine (10 microM)] or 8-bromoguanosine 3', 5'-cyclic-monophosphate (8-BrcGMP; 100 microM)] restored resting rCBF and L-NNA-induced attenuation of the whisker response in the presence of L-NNA, whereas the NO-independent vasodilator papaverine (1 mM) had no effect on the whisker response. Basal cGMP levels were decreased to 35{\%} by L-NNA and restored to 65{\%} of control by subsequent SNAP superfusion. Inhibition of neuronal NOS by 7-nitroindazole (7-NI; 40 mg/kg ip) or soluble guanylyl cyclase by 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ; 100 microM) significantly reduced resting rCBF to 86 +/- 8 and 92 +/- 10{\%} and whisker rCBF response to 7 +/- 4 and 12 +/- 3{\%}, respectively. ODQ reduced tissue cGMP to 54{\%}. 8-BrcGMP restored the whisker response in the presence of 7-NI or ODQ. We conclude that NO, produced by neuronal NOS, is a modulator in the coupling of neuronal activation and rCBF in rat somatosensory cortex and that this effect is mainly mediated by cGMP. L-NNA-induced vasomotion was significantly reduced during increased neuronal activity and after restoration of basal NO levels, but not after restoration of cGMP.},

abstract = {The diffusion of neuroactive substances in the extracellular space (ECS) plays an important role in short- and long-distance communication between nerve cells and is the underlying mechanism of extrasynaptic (volume) transmission. The diffusion properties of the ECS are described by three parameters: 1. ECS volume fraction alpha (alpha=ECS volume/total tissue volume), 2. tortuosity lambda (lambda2=free/apparent diffusion coefficient), reflecting the presence of diffusion barriers represented by, e.g., fine neuronal and glial processes or extracellular matrix molecules and 3. nonspecific uptake k'. These diffusion parameters differ in various brain regions, and diffusion in the CNS is therefore inhomogeneous. Moreover, diffusion barriers may channel the migration of molecules in the ECS, so that diffusion is facilitated in a certain direction, i.e. diffusion in certain brain regions is anisotropic. Changes in the diffusion parameters have been found in many physiological and pathological states in which cell swelling, glial remodeling and extracellular matrix changes are key factors influencing diffusion. Changes in ECS volume, tortuosity and anisotropy significantly affect the accumulation and diffusion of neuroactive substances in the CNS and thus extrasynaptic transmission, neuron-glia communication, transmitter "spillover" and synaptic cross-talk as well as cell migration, drug delivery and treatment.},

abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the reg- ulated interface between the peripheral circulation and the central nervous system (CNS). Although originally observed by Paul Ehrlich in 1885, the nature of the BBB was debated well into the 20th century. The anatomical substrate of the BBB is the cerebral microvascular en- dothelium, which, together with astrocytes, pericytes, neurons, and the extracellular matrix, constitute a “neu- rovascular unit” that is essential for the health and func- tion of the CNS. Tight junctions (TJ) between endothe- lial cells of the BBB restrict paracellular diffusion of water-soluble substances from blood to brain. The TJ is an intricate complex of transmembrane (junctional ad- hesion molecule-1, occludin, and claudins) and cytoplas- mic (zonula occludens-1 and -2, cingulin, AF-6, and 7H6) proteins linked to the actin cytoskeleton.Theexpression and subcellular localization of TJ proteins are modu- lated by several intrinsic signaling pathways, including those involving calcium, phosphorylation, and G-pro- teins. Disruption ofBBBTJ by disease or drugs can lead to impaired BBB function and thus compromise the CNS. Therefore, understanding how BBB TJ might be affected by various factors holds significant promise for the prevention and treatment of neurological diseases.},

abstract = {Increasing evidence supports a crucial role for glial metabolism in maintaining proper synaptic function and in the etiology of neurological disease. However, the study of glial metabolism in humans has been hampered by the lack of noninvasive methods. To specifically measure the contribution of astroglia to brain energy metabolism in humans, we used a novel noninvasive nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic approach. We measured carbon 13 incorporation into brain glutamate and glutamine in eight volunteers during an intravenous infusion of [2-13C] acetate, which has been shown in animal models to be metabolized specifically in astroglia. Mathematical modeling of the three established pathways for neurotransmitter glutamate repletion indicates that the glutamate/glutamine neurotransmitter cycle between astroglia and neurons (0.32 +/- 0.07 micromol x gm(-1) x min(-1)) is the major pathway for neuronal glutamate repletion and that the astroglial TCA cycle flux (0.14 +/- 0.06 micromol x gm(-1) x min(-1)) accounts for approximately 14{\%} of brain oxygen consumption. Up to 30{\%} of the glutamine transferred to the neurons by the cycle may derive from replacement of oxidized glutamate by anaplerosis. The further application of this approach could potentially enlighten the role of astroglia in supporting brain glutamatergic activity and in neurological and psychiatric disease.},

abstract = {Neuronal activity is thought to communicate to arterioles in the brain through astrocytic calcium (Ca(2+)) signaling to cause local vasodilation. Paradoxically, this communication may cause vasoconstriction in some cases. Here, we show that, regardless of the mechanism by which astrocytic endfoot Ca(2+) was elevated, modest increases in Ca(2+) induced dilation, whereas larger increases switched dilation to constriction. Large-conductance, Ca(2+)-sensitive potassium channels in astrocytic endfeet mediated a majority of the dilation and the entire vasoconstriction, implicating local extracellular K(+) as a vasoactive signal for both dilation and constriction. These results provide evidence for a unifying mechanism that explains the nature and apparent duality of the vascular response, showing that the degree and polarity of neurovascular coupling depends on astrocytic endfoot Ca(2+) and perivascular K(+).},

abstract = {We have developed a mathematical model of arterial vasomotion in which irregular rhythmic activity is generated by the nonlinear interaction of intracellular and membrane oscillators that depend on cyclic release of Ca2+ from internal stores and cyclic influx of extracellular Ca2+, respectively. Four key control variables were selected on the basis of the pharmacological characteristics of histamine-induced vasomotion in rabbit ear arteries: Ca2+ concentration in the cytosol, Ca2+ concentration in ryanodine-sensitive stores, cell membrane potential, and the open state probability of Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Although not represented by independent dynamic variables, the model also incorporates Na+/Ca2+ exchange, the Na+-K+-ATPase, Cl- fluxes, and Ca2+ efflux via the extrusion ATPase. Simulations reproduce a wide spectrum of experimental observations, including 1) the effects of interventions that modulate the functionality of Ca2+ stores and membrane ion channels, 2) paradoxes such as the apparently unpredictable dual action of Ca2+ antagonists and low extracellular Na+ concentration, which can abolish vasomotion or promote the appearance of large-amplitude oscillations, and 3) period-doubling, quasiperiodic, and intermittent routes to chaos. Nonlinearity is essential to explain these diverse patterns of experimental vascular response.},

abstract = {The conventional view of central nervous system (CNS) metabolism is based on the assumption that glucose is the main fuel source for active neurons and is processed in an oxidative manner. However, since the early 1990s research has challenged the idea that the energy needs of nerve cells are met exclusively by glucose and oxidative metabolism. This alternative view of glucose utilization contends that astrocytes metabolize glucose to lactate, which is then released and taken up by nearby neurons and used as a fuel source, commonly known as the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) model. Once thought of as a waste metabolite, lactate has emerged as a central player in the maintenance of neuronal function and long-term memory. Decreased neuronal metabolism has traditionally been viewed as a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, a more complex picture of CNS metabolism is emerging that may provide valuable insight into the pathophysiological changes that occur during AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. This review will examine the ANLS model and present recent evidence highlighting the critical role that lactate plays in neuronal survival and memory. Moreover, the role of glucose and lactate metabolism in AD will be re-evaluated from the perspective of the ANLS.},

Together, these cells orchestrate the inflammation and immunopathogenesis underlying the MS autoimmune disease processes and all up-regulate the same voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel, Kv1.3, when fully activated. Only microglia, which mediate central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory processes (possibly playing a dual role of CNS protection and mediation of neuroinflammation/ neurodegeneration), and DC, which are pivotal to the induction of T cell responses, express the distinct Kv1.5 prior to Kv1.3 upregulation. Although the precise functional roles of first Kv1.5 and then Kv1.3 channels are unclear, their differential expression is likely a common mechanism used by both microglia and DC, revealing Kv1.5 (in addition to Kv1.3) as a potentially important target for the development of new immunomodulatory therapies in MS.},

abstract = {Important among the responses of endothelial cells to flow stimuli are cytosolic-free calcium transients. These transients are mediated by several factors, including blood-borne agonists, extracellular calcium, and fluid-imposed shear forces. A mathematical model has been developed describing the recognition and transduction of shear stress to the second messenger cytosolic calcium. Shear stress modulates the calcium response via at least two modalities. First, mass transfer of agonist to the cell surface is enhanced by perfusion and is thus related to shear stress. Second, the permeability of the cell membrane to extracellular calcium increases upon exposure to shear stress. A mass balance for agonist in the perfusate is coupled to a previously published calcium dynamics model. Computations indicate a flow region where the transient moves from transport limited to kinetically limited. Parametric studies indicate distinct contributions to the time course by each step in the process. These steps include the time to develop the concentration boundary layer of agonist, receptor activation, and the mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores. Exogenous calcium is presumed to enter the cell via shear stress-gated ion channels. The model predicts a sigmoidal dependence of calcium influx upon shear stress. The peak value of the transient is determined largely by the agonist pathway, whereas the plateau level is governed by calcium influx. The model predicts the modulation of the calcium transient in the physiologically relevant range of flow and the associated shear stress. This implies that hemodynamics is important in regulating endothelial biology.},

abstract = {In a variety of cells, hormonal or neurotransmitter signals elicit a train of intracellular Ca2+ spikes. The analysis of a minimal model based on Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores shows how sustained oscillations of cytosolic Ca2+ may develop as a result of a rise in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) triggered by external stimulation. This rise elicits the release of a certain amount of Ca2+ from an InsP3-sensitive intracellular store. The subsequent rise in cytosolic Ca2+ in turn triggers the release of Ca2+ from a second store insensitive to InsP3. In contrast to the model proposed by Meyer and Stryer [Meyer, T. {\&} Stryer, L. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 5051-5055], the present model, which contains only two variables, predicts the occurrence of periodic Ca2+ spikes in the absence of InsP3 oscillations. Such results indicate that repetitive Ca2+ spikes evoked by external stimuli do not necessarily require the concomitant, periodic variation of InsP3. The model is closely related to that proposed by Kuba and Takeshita [Kuba, K. {\&} Takeshita, S. (1981) J. Theor. Biol. 93, 1009-1031] for Ca2+ oscillations in sympathetic neurones, based on Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ release. We extend their results by showing the minimal conditions in which the latter process gives rise to periodic behavior and take into account the role of the rise in InsP3 caused by external stimulation. The analysis further shows how signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations might be effectively encoded in terms of their frequency through the phosphorylation of a cellular substrate by a protein kinase activated by cytosolic Ca2+.},

abstract = {We propose a mechanism for agonist-stimulated Ca2+ oscillations that involves two roles for cytosolic Ca2+: (a) inhibition of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) stimulated Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and (b) stimulation of the production of IP3 through its action on phospholipase C (PLC), via a Gq protein related mechanism. Relying on quantitative experiments by Parker, I., and I. Ivorra (1990. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 87:260-264) on the inhibition of Ca2+ release from the ER using caged-IP3, we develop a kinetic model of inhibition that allows us to simulate closely their experiments. The model assumes that the ER IP3 receptor is a tetramer of independent subunits that can bind both Ca2+ and IP3. Upon incorporation of the action of Ca2+ on PLC that leads to production of IP3, we observe in-phase-oscillations of Ca2+ and IP3 at intermediate values of agonist stimulation. The oscillations occur on a time scale of 10-20 s, which is comparable to the time scale for inhibition in Xenopus oocytes. Analysis of the mechanism shows that Ca(2+)-inhibition of IP3-stimulated Ca2+ release from the ER is an essential step in the mechanism. We also find that the effect of Ca2+ on PLC can lead to an indirect increase of cytosolic Ca2+, superficially resembling "Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+)-release." The mechanism that we propose appears to be consistent with recent experiments on REF52 cells by Harootunian, A. T., J. P. Y. Kao, S. Paranjape, and R. Y. Tsien. (1991. Science [Wash. DC]. 251:75-78.) and we propose additional experiments to help test its underlying assumptions.},

abstract = {Arterial branchings closely fulfill several "bifurcation rules" which are deemed to optimize blood flow. The question is whether these local criteria in conjunction with a general optimization principle can explain the overall structure of an arterial tree. We present a model of an arterial vascular tree which is grown on the computer by successively adding terminal vessel segments. Each new terminal segment is connected to the optimum site within the preexisting tree, and the new bifurcation is optimized geometrically. After each step of adding and optimizing, the whole tree is rescaled to meet invariant boundary conditions of pressure and flow at each terminal site. Thus, local geometric optimization is used to induce simultaneously an optimized global structure. The comparison between the model and real coronary arterial trees shows good agreement regarding structural appearance, morphometric parameters, and pressure profiles.},

abstract = {The structural and functional integrity of the brain depends on the delicate balance between substrate delivery through blood flow and energy demands imposed by neural activity. Complex cerebrovascular control mechanisms ensure that active brain regions receive an adequate amount of blood, but the nature of these mechanisms remains elusive. Recent findings implicate perivascular neurons, gliovascular interactions and intramural vascular signalling in the control of the cerebral microcirculation. Neurons, astrocytes and vascular cells seem to constitute a functional unit, the primary purpose of which is to maintain the homeostasis of the brain's microenvironment. Alterations of these vascular regulatory mechanisms lead to brain dysfunction and disease. The emerging view is that cerebrovascular dysregulation is a feature not only of cerebrovascular pathologies, such as stroke, but also of neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Intercellular calcium waves have been observed in a large number of cell types, and are known to result from a variety of stimuli, including mechanical or hormonal stimulation. Recently, spiral intercellular waves of calcium have been observed in slices of hippocampal tissue. We use an existing model to study the properties of spiral intercellular calcium waves. Although intercellular spiral waves are well known in the context of cardiac muscle, due to the small value of the calcium diffusion coefficient intercellular calcium waves have fundamentally different properties. We show that homogenisation techniques give a good estimate for the plane wave speed, but do not describe spiral behaviour well. Using an expression for the effective diffusion coefficient we estimate the intercellular calcium permeability in liver. For the bistable equation, we derive an analytic estimate for the value of the intercellular permeability at which wave propagation fails. In the calcium wave model, we show numerically that the spiral period is first a decreasing, then an increasing, function of the intercellular permeability. We hypothesise that this is because the curvature of the spiral core is unimportant at low permeability, the period being approximately set instead by the speed of a plane wave along a line of coupled cells in one dimension.},

@article{Yin2006,
abstract = {It has been postulated that the development of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may result from an imbalance between the generation and clearance of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). Although familial AD appears to be caused by Abeta overproduction, sporadic AD (the most prevalent form) may result from impairment in clearance. Recent evidence suggests that several proteases may contribute to the degradation of Abeta. Furthermore, astrocytes have recently been implicated as a potential cellular mediator of Abeta degradation. In this study, we examined the possibility that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), proteases known to be expressed and secreted by astrocytes, could play a role in extracellular Abeta degradation. We found that astrocytes surrounding amyloid plaques showed enhanced expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in aged amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 mice. Moreover, astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) degraded Abeta, lowering levels and producing several fragments after incubation with synthetic human Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42). This activity was attenuated with specific inhibitors of MMP-2 and -9, as well as in ACM derived from mmp-2 or -9 knock-out (KO) mice. In vivo, significant increases in the steady-state levels of Abeta were found in the brains of mmp-2 and -9 KO mice compared with wild-type controls. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the MMPs with N-[(2R)-2-(hydroxamidocarbonylmethyl)-4-methylpentanoyl]-L-tryptophan methylamide (GM 6001) increased brain interstitial fluid Abeta levels and elimination of half-life in APPsw mice. These results suggest that MMP-2 and -9 may contribute to extracellular brain Abeta clearance by promoting Abeta catabolism.},

We present a multiscale RBC model that is able to predict RBC mechanics, rheology, and dynamics in agreement with experiments. Based on an analytic theory, the modeled membrane properties can be uniquely related to the experimentally established RBC macroscopic properties without any adjustment of parameters. The RBC linear and nonlinear elastic deformations match those obtained in optical-tweezers experiments. The rheological properties of the membrane are compared with those obtained in optical magnetic twisting cytometry, membrane thermal fluctuations, and creep followed by cell recovery. The dynamics of RBCs in shear and Poiseuille flows is tested against experiments and theoretical predictions, and the applicability of the latter is discussed. Our findings clearly indicate that a purely elastic model for the membrane cannot accurately represent the RBC's rheological properties and its dynamics, and therefore accurate modeling of a viscoelastic membrane is necessary.},

We used high-throughput histology to reconstruct the complete angioarchitecture and the positions of all neuronal somata of multiple cubic millimeter regions of vibrissa primary sensory cortex in mouse. Vascular networks were derived from the reconstruction. In contrast with the standard model of cortical columns that are tightly linked with the vascular network, graph-theoretical analyses revealed that the subsurface microvasculature formed interconnected loops with a topology that was invariant to the position and boundary of columns. Furthermore, the calculated patterns of blood flow in the networks were unrelated to location of columns. Rather, blood sourced by penetrating arterioles was effectively drained by the penetrating venules to limit lateral perfusion. This analysis provides the underpinning to understand functional imaging and the effect of penetrating vessels strokes on brain viability.},

abstract = {Large-conductance Ca-activated potassium channels (BK channels) are uniquely sensitive to both membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+. Recent work has demonstrated that in the gating of these channels there are voltage-sensitive steps that are separate from Ca2+ binding steps. Based on this result and the macroscopic steady state and kinetic properties of the cloned BK channel mslo, we have recently proposed a general kinetic scheme to describe the interaction between voltage and Ca2+ in the gating of the mslo channel (Cui, J., D.H. Cox, and R.W. Aldrich. 1997. J. Gen. Physiol. In press.). This scheme supposes that the channel exists in two main conformations, closed and open. The conformational change between closed and open is voltage dependent. Ca2+ binds to both the closed and open conformations, but on average binds more tightly to the open conformation and thereby promotes channel opening. Here we describe the basic properties of models of this form and test their ability to mimic mslo macroscopic steady state and kinetic behavior. The simplest form of this scheme corresponds to a voltage-dependent version of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model of allosteric proteins. The success of voltage-dependent MWC models in describing many aspects of mslo gating suggests that these channels may share a common molecular mechanism with other allosteric proteins whose behaviors have been modeled using the MWC formalism. We also demonstrate how this scheme can arise as a simplification of a more complex scheme that is based on the premise that the channel is a homotetramer with a single Ca2+ binding site and a single voltage sensor in each subunit. Aspects of the mslo data not well fitted by the simplified scheme will likely be better accounted for by this more general scheme. The kinetic schemes discussed in this paper may be useful in interpreting the effects of BK channel modifications or mutations.},

abstract = {We developed a mass transport model for a parallel-plate flow chamber apparatus to predict the concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) and adenine nucleotides (ATP, ADP) produced by cultured endothelial cells (ECs) and investigated how the net rates of production, degradation, and mass transport for these three chemical species vary with changes in wall shear stress ($\tau$w). These simulations provide an improved understanding of experimental results obtained with parallel-plate flow chambers and allows quantitative analysis of the relationship between $\tau$w, adenine nucleotide concentrations, and NO produced by ECs. Experimental data obtained after altering ATP and ADP concentrations with apyrase were analyzed to quantify changes in the rate of NO production (RNO). The effects of different isoforms of apyrase on ATP and ADP concentrations and nucleotide-dependent changes in RNO could be predicted with the model. A decrease in ATP was predicted with apyrase, but an increase in ADP was simulated due to degradation of ATP. We found that a simple proportional relationship relating a component of RNO to the sum of ATP and ADP provided a close match to the fitted curve for experimentally measured changes in RNO with apyrase. Estimates for the proportionality constant ranged from 0.0067 to 0.0321 $\mu$M/s increase in RNO per nM nucleotide concentration, depending on which isoform of apyrase was modeled, with the largest effect of nucleotides on RNO at low $\tau$w ({\textless}6 dyn/cm2).},

abstract = {The brain possesses two intricate mechanisms that fulfill its continuous metabolic needs: cerebral autoregulation, which ensures constant cerebral blood flow over a wide range of arterial pressures and functional hyperemia, which ensures rapid delivery of oxygen and glucose to active neurons. Over the past decade, a number of important studies have identified astrocytes as key intermediaries in neurovascular coupling (NVC), the mechanism by which active neurons signal blood vessels to change their diameter. Activity-dependent increases in astrocytic Ca{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} activity are thought to contribute to the release of vasoactive substances that facilitate arteriole vasodilation. A number of vasoactive signals have been identified and their role on vessel caliber assessed both in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we discuss mechanisms implicating astrocytes in NVC-mediated vascular responses, limitations encountered as a result of the challenges in maintaining all the constituents of the neurovascular unit intact and deliberate current controversial findings disputing a main role for astrocytes in NVC. Finally, we briefly discuss the potential role of pericytes and microglia in NVC-mediated processes.},

abstract = {Astrocytes are considered the third component of the synapse, responding to neurotransmitter release from synaptic terminals and releasing gliotransmitters--including glutamate--in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner to affect neuronal synaptic activity. Many studies reporting astrocyte-driven neuronal activity have evoked astrocyte Ca(2+) increases by application of endogenous ligands that directly activate neuronal receptors, making astrocyte contribution to neuronal effect(s) difficult to determine. We have made transgenic mice that express a Gq-coupled receptor only in astrocytes to evoke astrocyte Ca(2+) increases using an agonist that does not bind endogenous receptors in brain. By recording from CA1 pyramidal cells in acute hippocampal slices from these mice, we demonstrate that widespread Ca(2+) elevations in 80{\%}-90{\%} of stratum radiatum astrocytes do not increase neuronal Ca(2+), produce neuronal slow inward currents, or affect excitatory synaptic activity. Our findings call into question the developing consensus that Ca(2+)-dependent glutamate release by astrocytes directly affects neuronal synaptic activity in situ.},

abstract = {A consistent and prominent feature of brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is the presence of low-frequency ({\textless}0.1 Hz) fluctuations of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal that are thought to reflect spontaneous neuronal activity. In this report we provide modeling evidence that cyclic physiological activation of astroglial cells produces similar BOLD oscillations through a mechanism mediated by intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Specifically, neurotransmission induces pulses of Ca2+ concentration in astrocytes, resulting in increased cerebral perfusion and neuroactive transmitter release by these cells (i.e., gliotransmission), which in turn stimulates neuronal activity. Noticeably, the level of neuron-astrocyte cross talk regulates the periodic behavior of the Ca2+ wave-induced BOLD fluctuations. Our results suggest that the spontaneous ongoing activity of neuroglial networks is a potential source of the observed slow fMRI signal oscillations.},

abstract = {Historically, the neuron has been the conceptual focus for almost all of neuroscience research. In recent years, however, the concept of the neurovascular unit has emerged as a new paradigm for investigating both physiology and pathology in the CNS. This concept proposes that a purely neurocentric focus is not sufficient, and emphasizes that all cell types in the brain including neuronal, glial and vascular components, must be examined in an integrated context. Cell-cell signaling and coupling between these different compartments form the basis for normal function. Disordered signaling and perturbed coupling form the basis for dysfunction and disease. In this mini-review, we will survey four examples of this phenomenon: hemodynamic neurovascular coupling linking blood flow to brain activity; cellular communications that evoke the blood-brain barrier phenotype; parallel systems that underlie both neurogenesis and angiogenesis in the CNS; and finally, the potential exchange of trophic factors that may link neuronal, glial and vascular homeostasis.},

abstract = {It has long been assumed that one important mechanism for the dissipation of local potassium gradients in the brain extracellular space is the so-called spatial buffer, generally associated with glial cells. To date, however, there has been no analytical description of the characteristic patterns of K ϩ clearance mediated by such a mechanism. This study reanalyzed a mathematical model of Gardner-Medwin (1983, J. Physiol. (Lond.). 335:393– 426) that had previously been solved numer-ically. Under suitable approximations, the transient solutions for the potassium concentrations and the corresponding membrane potentials of glial cells in a finite, parallel domain were derived. The analytic results were substantiated by numerical simulations of a detailed two-compartment model. This simulation explored the dependence of spatial buffer current and extracellular K ϩ on the distribution of inward rectifier K ϩ channels in the glial endfoot and nonendfoot membranes, the glial geometric length, and the effect of passive KCl uptake. Regarding the glial cells as an equivalent leaky cable, the analyses indicated that a maximum endfoot current occurs when the glial geometric length is equal to the corresponding electrotonic space constant. Consequently, a long glial process is unsuitable for spatial buffering, unless the axial space constant can match the length of the process. Finally, this study discussed whether the spatial buffer mechanism is able to efficiently transport K ϩ over distances of more than several glial space constants.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO), a free gaseous signaling molecule, is involved in the regulation of the cardiovascular, nervous and immune system. The neurotransmitter function of nitric oxide is dependent on dynamic regulation of its biosynthetic enzyme, nitric oxide synthase (NOS). There are three types of NOS, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Of the three NOS, we focus on nNOS in the present review. Brain nNOS exists in particulate and soluble forms and the differential subcellular localization of nNOS may contribute to its diverse functions. Proteins bearing PDZ domains can interact directly with the PDZ domain of nNOS, influencing the subcellular distribution and/or activity of the enzyme. During the past several years, an increasing number of reports have demonstrated the importance of nNOS in a variety of synaptic signaling events. nNOS has been implicated in modulating physiological functions such as learning, memory, and neurogenesis, as well as being involved in a number of human diseases. In this review we concentrate on recent findings regarding the structural features, subcellular localization and factors regulating nNOS function. In particular, we conclude with a section discussing the role of nNOS in a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions.},

The activity and protein expression of nitric oxide synthase and arginase were altered with AD and age in a region-specific manner. There were also AD- and age-related changes in the tissue concentrations of L-arginine and its downstream metabolites (L-citrulline, L-ornithine, agmatine, putrescine, spermidine, spermine, glutamate, ??-aminobutyric acid, and glutamine) in a metabolite- or region-specific manner. These findings demonstrate that arginine metabolism is dramatically altered in diverse regions of AD brains, thus meriting further investigation to understand its role in the pathogenesis and/or progression of the disease. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The classical Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model neglects the time-dependence of ion concentrations in spiking dynamics. The dynamics is therefore limited to a time scale of milliseconds, which is determined by the membrane capacitance multiplied by the resistance of the ion channels, and by the gating time constants. We study slow dynamics in an extended HH framework that includes time-dependent ion concentrations, pumps, and buffers. Fluxes across the neuronal membrane change intra- and extracellular ion concentrations, whereby the latter can also change through contact to reservoirs in the surroundings. Ion gain and loss of the system is identified as a bifurcation parameter whose essential importance was not realized in earlier studies. Our systematic study of the bifurcation structure and thus the phase space structure helps to understand activation and inhibition of a new excitability in ion homeostasis which emerges in such extended models. Also modulatory mechanisms that regulate the spiking rate can be explained by bifurcations. The dynamics on three distinct slow times scales is determined by the cell volume-to-surface-area ratio and the membrane permeability (seconds), the buffer time constants (tens of seconds), and the slower backward buffering (minutes to hours). The modulatory dynamics and the newly emerging excitable dynamics corresponds to pathological conditions observed in epileptiform burst activity, and spreading depression in migraine aura and stroke, respectively.},

Furthermore, impairments in astrocytic function are increasingly being recognized as an important contributor to neuronal dysfunction and, in particular, neurodegenerative processes. In this review, we discuss recent evidence supporting important roles for astrocytes in neuropathological conditions such as neuroinflammation, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.

Diffusible messengers such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostanoids are considered to work as vasodilators in neurovascular coupling. However, their roles are still controversial. In the present study, cortical images of neural activities and vasodilation were recorded through the intact skull of C57BL/6 mice anesthetized with urethane. Flavoprotein fluorescence responses elicited by vibratory hindpaw stimulation were followed by darkening of arteriole images reflecting vasodilation in the somatosensory cortex. Vasodilation was also observed in light reflection images at the wavelength of 570 nm in the same mice. We perfused the surface of the cortex under the skull with 100 ??M NG-nitro-l-arginine (l-NA), an inhibitor of NO synthase (NOS), and 10 ??M indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX). These drugs suppressed vasodilation without changing flavoprotein fluorescence responses. A mixture of l-NA and indomethacin almost completely eliminated vasodilation. In mice lacking neuronal NOS (nNOS), activity-dependent vasodilation was significantly suppressed compared with that in littermate control mice, while that in mice lacking cytosolic phospholipase A2 ?? (cPLA2??) was unchanged. These results indicate that NO works as a vasodilator in neurovascular coupling of the mouse somatosensory cortex. ?? 2007.},

abstract = {The spatiotemporal activities of astrocyte Ca2+ signaling in mature neuronal circuits remain unclear. We used genetically encoded Ca2+ and glutamate indicators as well as pharmacogenetic and electrical control of neurotransmitter release to explore astrocyte activity in the hippocampal mossy fiber pathway. Our data revealed numerous localized, spontaneous Ca2+ signals in astrocyte branches and territories, but these were not driven by neuronal activity or glutamate. Moreover, evoked astrocyte Ca2+ signaling changed linearly with the number of mossy fiber action potentials. Under these settings, astrocyte responses were global, suppressed by neurotransmitter clearance, and mediated by glutamate and GABA. Thus, astrocyte engagement in the fully developed mossy fiber pathway was slow and territorial, contrary to that frequently proposed for astrocytes within microcircuits. We show that astrocyte Ca2+ signaling functionally segregates large volumes of neuropil and that these transients are not suited for responding to, or regulating, single synapses in the mossy fiber pathway. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Treatment options for stroke remain limited. Neuroprotective therapies, in particular, have invariably failed to yield the expected benefit in stroke patients, despite robust theoretical and mechanistic background and promising animal data. Insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) play a pivotal role in critical brain functions, such as energy homeostasis, neuronal growth, and differentiation. They may exhibit neuroprotective properties in acute ischemic stroke based upon their vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects, as well as improvements of functional connectivity, neuronal metabolism, neurotransmitter regulation, and remyelination. Intranasally administered insulin has demonstrated a benefit for prevention of cognitive decline in older people, and IGF-1 has shown potential benefit to improve functional outcomes in animal models of acute ischemic stroke. The intranasal route presents a feasible, tolerable, safe, and particularly effective administration route, bypassing the blood-brain barrier and maximizing distribution to the central nervous system (CNS), without the disadvantages of systemic side effects and first-pass metabolism. This review summarizes the neuroprotective potential of intranasally administered insulin and IGF-1 in stroke patients. We present the theoretical background and pathophysiologic mechanisms, animal and human studies of intranasal insulin and IGF-1, and the safety and feasibility of intranasal route for medication administration to the CNS.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes in midlife or late life increases the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD), and type 1 diabetes has been associated with a higher risk of detrimental cognitive outcomes, although studies from older adults are lacking. We investigated whether individuals with AD were more likely to have a history of diabetes than matched controls from the general aged population.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Information on reimbursed diabetes medication (including both type 1 and 2 diabetes) of all Finnish individuals with reimbursed AD medication in 2005 (n = 28,093) and their AD-free control subjects during 1972-2005 was obtained from a special reimbursement register maintained by the Social Insurance Institute of Finland.

RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes was 11.4{\%} in the whole study population, 10.7{\%} (n = 3,012) among control subjects, and 12.0{\%} (n = 3,372) among AD case subjects. People with AD were more likely to have diabetes than matched control subjects (unadjusted OR 1.14 [95{\%} CI 1.08-1.20]), even after adjusting for cardiovascular diseases (OR 1.31 [1.22-1.41]). The associations were stronger with diabetes diagnosed at midlife (adjusted OR 1.60 [1.34-1.84] and 1.25 [1.16-1.36] for midlife and late-life diabetes, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with clinically verified AD are more likely to have a history of clinically verified and medically treated diabetes than the general aged population, although the difference is small.},

Are these cells only filling up the space and passively nurturing the neurons, or do they also contribute to information transfer and processing? After several years of intense research since the pioneer discovery of astrocytic calcium waves and glutamate release onto neurons in vitro, the neuronal-glial studies have answered many questions thanks to technological advances. However, the definitive in vivo role of astrocytes remains to be addressed. In addition, it is becoming clear that diverse populations of astrocytes coexist with different molecular identities and specialized functions adjusted to their microenvironment, but do they all belong to the umbrella family of astrocytes? One population of astrocytes takes on a new function by displaying both support cell and stem cell characteristics in the neurogenic niches. Here, we define characteristics that classify a cell as an astrocyte under physiological conditions. We will also discuss the well-established and emerging functions of astrocytes with an emphasis on their roles on neuronal activity and as neural stem cells in adult neurogenic zones. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a slow-moving ionic and metabolic disturbance that propagates in cortical brain tissue. In addition to massive cellular depolarizations, CSD also involves significant changes in perfusion and metabolism-aspects of CSD that had not been modeled and are important to traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and migraine. In this study, we develop a mathematical model for CSD where we focus on modeling the features essential to understanding the implications of neurovascular coupling during CSD. In our model, the sodium-potassium-ATPase, mainly responsible for ionic homeostasis and active during CSD, operates at a rate that is dependent on the supply of oxygen. The supply of oxygen is determined by modeling blood flow through a lumped vascular tree with an effective local vessel radius that is controlled by the extracellular potassium concentration. We show that during CSD, the metabolic demands of the cortex exceed the physiological limits placed on oxygen delivery, regardless of vascular constriction or dilation. However, vasoconstriction and vasodilation play important roles in the propagation of CSD and its recovery. Our model replicates the qualitative and quantitative behavior of CSD--vasoconstriction, oxygen depletion, extracellular potassium elevation, prolonged depolarization--found in experimental studies. We predict faster, longer duration CSD in vivo than in vitro due to the contribution of the vasculature. Our results also help explain some of the variability of CSD between species and even within the same animal. These results have clinical and translational implications, as they allow for more precise in vitro, in vivo, and in silico exploration of a phenomenon broadly relevant to neurological disease.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide contrasts with most intercellular messengers because it diffuses rapidly and isotropically through most tissues with little reaction but cannot be transported through the vasculature due to rapid destruction by oxyhemoglobin. The rapid diffusion of nitric oxide between cells allows it to locally integrate the responses of blood vessels to turbulence, modulate synaptic plasticity in neurons, and control the oscillatory behavior of neuronal networks. Nitric oxide is not necessarily short lived and is intrinsically no more reactive than oxygen. The reactivity of nitric oxide per se has been greatly overestimated in vitro because no drain is provided to remove nitric oxide. Nitric oxide persists in solution for several minutes in micromolar concentrations before it reacts with oxygen to form much stronger oxidants like nitrogen dioxide. Nitric oxide is removed within seconds in vivo by diffusion over 100 microns through tissues to enter red blood cells and react with oxyhemoglobin. The direct toxicity of nitric oxide is modest but is greatly enhanced by reacting with superoxide to form peroxynitrite (ONOO-). Nitric oxide is the only biological molecule produced in high enough concentrations to out-compete superoxide dismutase for superoxide. Peroxynitrite reacts relatively slowly with most biological molecules, making peroxynitrite a selective oxidant. Peroxynitrite modifies tyrosine in proteins to create nitrotyrosines, leaving a footprint detectable in vivo. Nitration of structural proteins, including neurofilaments and actin, can disrupt filament assembly with major pathological consequences. Antibodies to nitrotyrosine have revealed nitration in human atherosclerosis, myocardial ischemia, septic and distressed lung, inflammatory bowel disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.},

abstract = {Intracranial pressure (ICP) is affected in many neurological conditions. Clinical measurement of pressure on the brain currently requires placing a probe in the cerebrospinal fluid compartment, the brain tissue, or other intracranial space. This invasiveness limits the measurement to critically ill patients. Because ICP is also clinically important in conditions ranging from brain tumors and hydrocephalus to concussions, noninvasive determination of ICP would be desirable. Our model-based approach to continuous estimation and tracking of ICP uses routinely obtainable time-synchronized, noninvasive (or minimally invasive) measurements of peripheral arterial blood pressure and blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCA), both at intra-heartbeat resolution. A physiological model of cerebrovascular dynamics provides mathematical constraints that relate the measured waveforms to ICP. Our algorithm produces patient-specific ICP estimates with no calibration or training. Using 35 hours of data from 37 patients with traumatic brain injury, we generated ICP estimates on 2665 nonoverlapping 60-beat data windows. Referenced against concurrently recorded invasive parenchymal ICP that varied over 100 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) across all records, our estimates achieved a mean error (bias) of 1.6 mmHg and SD of error (SDE) of 7.6 mmHg. For the 1673 data windows over 22 hours in which blood flow velocity recordings were available from both the left and the right MCA, averaging the resulting bilateral ICP estimates reduced the bias to 1.5 mmHg and SDE to 5.9 mmHg. This accuracy is already comparable to that of some invasive ICP measurement methods in current clinical use.},

The brain, in a similar manner to the heart requires this mechanism to be extremely quick acting, relative to other ways of altering perfusion such as varying systemic blood pressure, since oxygen depravation in the tissues of the brain can be tolerated for only of the order of tens of seconds before significant damage can be done. In recent years computational models, and it must be noted computer architecture have evolved to an extent where mathematicians and engineers can play a large part in discovering how the brain functions physiologically as well as investigating pathological conditions. This review will look at a number of increasingly complex computational models of blood flow to the brain and how variations in arterial geometry can influence the perfusion in the cerebral vasculature. Although these models have provided an insight into complex mechanisms the research area is densely populated with important questions that perhaps only computer models can answer.

abstract = {Many cells express ryanodine receptors (RyRs) whose activation is thought to amplify depolarization-evoked elevations in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+](i) through a process of Ca2+ -induced Ca2+ release (CICR). In neurons, it is usually assumed that CICR triggers net Ca2+ release from an ER Ca2+ store. However, since net ER Ca 2+ transport depends on the relative rates of Ca2+ uptake and release via distinct pathways, weak activation of a CICR pathway during periods of ER Ca accumulation would have a totally different effect: attenuation of Ca2+ accumulation. Stronger CICR activation at higher [Ca2+](i) could further attenuate Ca2+ accumulation or trigger net Ca2+ release, depending on the quantitative properties of the underlying Ca2+ transporters. This and the companion study (Hongpaisan, J., N.B. Pivovarova, S.L. Colgrove, R.D. Leapman, and D.D. Friel, and S.B. Andrews. 2001. J. Gen. Physiol. 118:101-112) investigate which of these CICR "modes" operate during depolarization-induced Ca2+ entry in sympathetic neurons. The present study focuses on small [Ca2+](i) elevations (less than approximately 350 nM) evoked by weak depolarization. The following two approaches were used: (1) Ca2+ fluxes were estimated from simultaneous measurements of [Ca2+](i) and I(Ca) in fura-2-loaded cells (perforated patch conditions), and (2) total ER Ca concentrations ([Ca](ER)) were measured using X-ray microanalysis. Flux analysis revealed triggered net Ca2+ release during depolarization in the presence but not the absence of caffeine, and [Ca2+](i) responses were accelerated by SERCA inhibitors, implicating ER Ca2+ accumulation, which was confirmed by direct [Ca](ER) measurements. Ryanodine abolished caffeine-induced CICR and enhanced depolarization-induced ER Ca2+ accumulation, indicating that activation of the CICR pathway normally attenuates ER Ca2+ accumulation, which is a novel mechanism for accelerating evoked [Ca2+](i) responses. Theory shows how such a low gain mode of CICR can operate during weak stimulation and switch to net Ca2+ release at high [Ca2+](i), a transition demonstrated in the companion study. These results emphasize the importance of the relative rates of Ca2+ uptake and release in defining ER contributions to depolarization-induced Ca2+ signals.},

abstract = {Modern neuroimaging techniques rely on neurovascular coupling to show regions of increased brain activation. However, little is known of the neurovascular coupling relationships that exist for inhibitory signals. To address this issue directly we developed a preparation to investigate the signal sources of one of these proposed inhibitory neurovascular signals, the negative blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response (NBR), in rat somatosensory cortex. We found a reliable NBR measured in rat somatosensory cortex in response to unilateral electrical whisker stimulation, which was located in deeper cortical layers relative to the positive BOLD response. Separate optical measurements (two-dimensional optical imaging spectroscopy and laser Doppler flowmetry) revealed that the NBR was a result of decreased blood volume and flow and increased levels of deoxyhemoglobin. Neural activity in the NBR region, measured by multichannel electrodes, varied considerably as a function of cortical depth. There was a decrease in neuronal activity in deep cortical laminae. After cessation of whisker stimulation there was a large increase in neural activity above baseline. Both the decrease in neuronal activity and increase above baseline after stimulation cessation correlated well with the simultaneous measurement of blood flow suggesting that the NBR is related to decreases in neural activity in deep cortical layers. Interestingly, the magnitude of the neural decrease was largest in regions showing stimulus-evoked positive BOLD responses. Since a similar type of neural suppression in surround regions was associated with a negative BOLD signal, the increased levels of suppression in positive BOLD regions could importantly moderate the size of the observed BOLD response.},

abstract = {The coupling between neuronal activity and cerebral blood flow (CBF) is essential for normal brain function. The mechanisms behind this neurovascular coupling process remain elusive, mainly because of difficulties in probing dynamically the functional and coordinated interaction between neurons and the vasculature in vivo. Direct and simultaneous measurements of nitric oxide (NO) dynamics and CBF changes in hippocampus in vivo support the notion that during glutamatergic activation nNOS-derived NO induces a time-, space-, and amplitude-coupled increase in the local CBF, later followed by a transient increase in local O2 tension. These events are dependent on the activation of the NMDA-glutamate receptor and nNOS, without a significant contribution of endothelial-derived NO or astrocyte-neuron signaling pathways. Upon diffusion of NO from active neurons, the vascular response encompasses the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase. Hence, in the hippocampus, neurovascular coupling is mediated by nNOS-derived NO via a diffusional connection between active glutamatergic neurons and blood vessels. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The brain needs a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients (essentially glucose). Normal day-to-day life provides a variety of pressure variations in the body and the brain needs to react to these. It does so by varying the resistance of the vasculature, a process known as autoregulation. There are a number of different mechanisms that allow this to occur. Myogenic regulation allows for variations in the arterial radius due to systemic pressure variations. Fluid shear stress exerted on the monocellular layer called the endothelium activates ion channels in both the underlying smooth muscle cells and the endothelium. The ions transported into the cells cause the smooth muscle cells to either contract or dilate. The third mechanism is metabolic in its form. Here the rate of oxygen delivery can allow variations in arteriolar diameters again by cellular variations in calcium ions.We present below numerical and mathematical models which allow investigation of the important pathways, parameters and pathologies of autoregulation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) derived from nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is an important paracrine effector that maintains vascular tone. The release of NO mediated by NOS isozymes under various O2 conditions critically determines the NO bioavailability in tissues. Because of experimental difficulties, there has been no direct information on how enzymatic NO production and distribution change around arterioles under various oxygen conditions. In this study, we used computational models based on the analysis of biochemical pathways of enzymatic NO synthesis and the availability of NOS isozymes to quantify the NO production by neuronal NOS (NOS1) and endothelial NOS (NOS3). We compared the catalytic activities of NOS1 and NOS3 and their sensitivities to the concentration of substrate O2. Based on the NO release rates predicted from kinetic models, the geometric distribution of NO sources, and mass balance analysis, we predicted the NO concentration profiles around an arteriole under various O2 conditions. The results indicated that NOS1-catalyzed NO production was significantly more sensitive to ambient O2 concentration than that catalyzed by NOS3. Also, the high sensitivity of NOS1 catalytic activity to O2 was associated with significantly reduced NO production and therefore NO concentrations, upon hypoxia. Moreover, the major source determining the distribution of NO was NOS1, which was abundantly expressed in the nerve fibers and mast cells close to arterioles, rather than NOS3, which was expressed in the endothelium. Finally, the perivascular NO concentration predicted by the models under conditions of normoxia was paradoxically at least an order of magnitude lower than a number of experimental measurements, suggesting a higher abundance of NOS1 or NOS3 and/or the existence of other enzymatic or nonenzymatic sources of NO in the microvasculature. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

It is clear that the generation and actions of NO under physiological and pathophysiological conditions are exquisitely regulated and extend to almost every cell type and function within the circulation. While the molecule mediates many physiological functions, an excessive presence of NO is toxic to cells. The enzyme NOS, constitutively or inductively, catalyses the production of NO in several biological systems. NO is derived not only from NOS isoforms but also from NOS-independent sources. In mammals, to date, three distinct NOS isoforms have been identified: neuronal NOS (nNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS), and endothelial NOS (eNOS). The molecular structure, enzymology and pharmacology of these enzymes have been well defined, and reveal critical roles for the NOS system in a variety of important physiological processes. This review focuses on recent advances in the understanding of the interactions between NOS enzymes and pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and the role of NO agonists as potential therapeutic agents in treatment of CVD},

abstract = {Extrasynaptic communication between neurons or neurons and glia is mediated by the diffusion of neuroactive substances in the volume of the extracellular space (ECS). The size and irregular geometry of the diffusion channels in the ECS substantially differ not only around individual cells but also in different CNS regions and thus affect and direct the movement of various neuroactive substances in the ECS. Diffusion in the CNS is therefore not only inhomogeneous, but often also anisotropic. The diffusion parameters in adult mammals (including humans), ECS volume fraction {\$}\alpha{\$} ({\$}\alpha{\$}=ECS volume/total tissue volume) and tortuosity {\$}\lambda{\$} ({\$}\lambda{\$} 2=free/apparent diffusion coefficient), are typically 0.20-0.25 and 1.5-1.6, respectively, and as such hinder the diffusion of neuroactive substances and water. These diffusion parameters modulate neuronal signaling, neuron-glia communication and extrasynaptic "volume" transmission. A significant decrease in ECS volume fraction and an increase in diffusion barriers (tortuosity) occur during neuronal activity and pathological states. The changes are often related to cell swelling, cell loss, astrogliosis, the rearrangement of neuronal and astrocytic processes and changes in the extracellular matrix. They are also altered during physiological states such as development, lactation and aging. Plastic changes in ECS volume, tortuosity and anisotropy significantly affect neuron-glia communication, the spatial relation of glial processes toward synapses, glutamate or GABA 'spillover' and synaptic crosstalk. The various changes in tissue diffusivity occurring during many pathological states are important for diagnosis, drug delivery and treatment. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2004 IBRO.

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) produced by vascular endothelial cells is a potent vasodilator and an antiinflammatory mediator. Regulating production of endothelial-derived NO is a complex undertaking, involving multiple signaling and genetic pathways that are activated by diverse humoral and biomechanical stimuli. To gain a thorough understanding of the rich diversity of responses observed experimentally, it is necessary to account for an ensemble of these pathways acting simultaneously. In this article, we have assembled four quantitative molecular pathways previously proposed for shear-stress-induced NO production. In these pathways, endothelial NO synthase is activated 1), via calcium release, 2), via phosphorylation reactions, and 3), via enhanced protein expression. To these activation pathways, we have added a fourth, a pathway describing actual NO production from endothelial NO synthase and its various protein partners. These pathways were combined and simulated using CytoSolve, a computational environment for combining independent pathway calculations. The integrated model is able to describe the experimentally observed change in NO production with time after the application of fluid shear stress. This model can also be used to predict the specific effects on the system after interventional pharmacological or genetic changes. Importantly, this model reflects the up-to-date understanding of the NO system, providing a platform upon which information can be aggregated in an additive way. {\textcopyright} 2013 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Despite its very potent vasodilating action in vivo, acetylcholine (ACh) does not always produce relaxation of isolated preparations of blood vessels in vitro. For example, in the helical strip of the rabbit descending thoracic aorta, the only reported response to ACh has been graded contractions, occurring at concentrations above 0.1 muM and mediated by muscarinic receptors. Recently, we observed that in a ring preparation from the rabbit thoracic aorta, ACh produced marked relaxation at concentrations lower than those required to produce contraction (confirming an earlier report by Jelliffe). In investigating this apparent discrepancy, we discovered that the loss of relaxation of ACh in the case of the strip was the result of unintentional rubbing of its intimal surface against foreign surfaces during its preparation. If care was taken to avoid rubbing of the intimal surface during preparation, the tissue, whether ring, transverse strip or helical strip, always exhibited relaxation to ACh, and the possibility was considered that rubbing of the intimal surface had removed endothelial cells. We demonstrate here that relaxation of isolated preparations of rabbit thoracic aorta and other blood vessels by ACh requires the presence of endothelial cells, and that ACh, acting on muscarinic receptors of these cells, stimulates release of a substance(s) that causes relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle. We propose that this may be one of the principal mechanisms for ACh-induced vasodilation in vivo. Preliminary reports on some aspects of the work have been reported elsewhere.},

The Roy and Sherrington hypothesis has been widely accepted to account for the phenomenon: increased neuronal metabolic activity will give rise to the accumulation of vasoactive catabolites, which decrease vascular resistance and thereby increase blood flow until normal homeostasis is reestablished. However, the hypothesis does not account for the disproportionate increase in flow that occurs in a number of circumstances. There are additional difficulties in reconciling more recent experimental data with the Roy and Sherrington hypothesis. In this review we direct attention toward the rich perivascular nerve supply to all parts of the cerebral circulation as possibly being an alternative control system allowing for rapid parallel changes in flow and neuronal activity.},

abstract = {Impaired mass transfer characteristics of blood-borne vasoactive species such as adenosine triphosphate in regions such as an arterial bifurcation have been hypothesized as a prospective mechanism in the aetiology of atherosclerotic lesions. Arterial endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) respond differentially to altered local haemodynamics and produce coordinated macro-scale responses via intercellular communication. Using a computationally designed arterial segment comprising large populations of mathematically modelled coupled ECs and SMCs, we investigate their response to spatial gradients of blood-borne agonist concentrations and the effect of micro-scale-driven perturbation on the macro-scale. Altering homocellular (between same cell type) and heterocellular (between different cell types) intercellular coupling, we simulated four cases of normal and pathological arterial segments experiencing an identical gradient in the concentration of the agonist. Results show that the heterocellular calcium (Ca(2+)) coupling between ECs and SMCs is important in eliciting a rapid response when the vessel segment is stimulated by the agonist gradient. In the absence of heterocellular coupling, homocellular Ca(2+) coupling between SMCs is necessary for propagation of Ca(2+) waves from downstream to upstream cells axially. Desynchronized intracellular Ca(2+) oscillations in coupled SMCs are mandatory for this propagation. Upon decoupling the heterocellular membrane potential, the arterial segment looses the inhibitory effect of ECs on the Ca(2+) dynamics of the underlying SMCs. The full system comprises hundreds of thousands of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations simulated on the massively parallel Blue Gene architecture. The use of massively parallel computational architectures shows the capability of this approach to address macro-scale phenomena driven by elementary micro-scale components of the system.},

abstract = {Three types of vascular dysfunction have been described in multiple sclerosis (MS). First, findings from epidemiological studies suggest that patients with MS have a higher risk for ischaemic stroke than people who do not have MS. The underlying mechanism is unknown, but might involve endothelial dysfunction secondary to inflammatory disease activity and increased plasma homocysteine concentrations. Second, patients with MS have global cerebral hypoperfusion, which might predispose them to the development of ischaemic stroke. The widespread decrease in perfusion in normal-appearing white matter and grey matter in MS seems not to be secondary to axonal degeneration, but might be a result of reduced axonal activity, reduced astrocyte energy metabolism, and perhaps increased blood concentrations of endothelin-1. Data suggest that a subtype of focal MS lesions might have an ischaemic origin, and there seems to be a link between reduced white matter perfusion and cognitive dysfunction in MS. Third, the pathology of MS might be the consequence of a chronic state of impaired venous drainage from the CNS, for which the term chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) has been coined. A number of recent vascular studies do not support the CCSVI theory, but some elements of CCSVI might be explained by slower cerebral venous blood flow secondary to the reduced cerebral perfusion in patients with MS compared with healthy individuals. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {All sciences, including astronomy, are now entering the era of information abundance. The exponentially increasing volume and complexity of modern data sets promises to transform the scientific practice, but also poses a number of common technological challenges. The Virtual Observatory concept is the astronomical community's response to these challenges: it aims to harness the progress in information technology in the service of astronomy, and at the same time provide a valuable testbed for information technology and applied computer science. Challenges broadly fall into two categories: data handling (or "data farming"), including issues such as archives, intelligent storage, databases, interoperability, fast networks, etc., and data mining, data understanding, and knowledge discovery, which include issues such as automated clustering and classification, multivariate correlation searches, pattern recognition, visualization in highly hyperdimensional parameter spaces, etc., as well as various applications of machine learning in these contexts. Such techniques are forming a methodological foundation for science with massive and complex data sets in general, and are likely to have a much broather impact on the modern society, commerce, information economy, security, etc. There is a powerful emerging synergy between the computationally enabled science and the science-driven computing, which will drive the progress in science, scholarship, and many other venues in the 21st century.},

Altered activities of these substances in patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease (e.g., hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes, aging, postmenopausal status, smoking, and infections) appear to underlie the atherosclerotic process. There is increasing evidence from both preclinical studies and clinical trials that nitric oxide (NO) plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of arteriosclerosis.

abstract = {Periods of chronic hypoxia, which can arise from numerous cardiorespiratory disorders, predispose individuals to the development of dementias, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is characterized in part by the increased production of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), which forms the extracellular plaques by which the disease can be identified post mortem. Numerous studies have now shown that hypoxia, even in vitro, can increase production of Abeta in different cell types. Evidence has been produced to indicate hypoxia alters both expression of the Abeta precursor, APP, and also the expression of the secretase enzymes, which cleave Abeta from APP. Other studies implicate reduced Abeta degradation as a possible means by which hypoxia increases Abeta levels. Such variability may be attributable to cell-specific responses to hypoxia. Further evidence indicates that some, but not all of the cellular adaptations to chronic hypoxia (including alteration of Ca(2+) homeostasis) require Abeta formation. However, other aspects of hypoxic remodeling of cell function appear to occur independently of this process. The molecular and cellular responses to hypoxia contribute to our understanding of the clinical association of hypoxia and increased incidence of AD. However, it remains to be determined whether inhibition of one or more of the effects of hypoxia may be of benefit in arresting the development of this neurodegenerative disease.},

abstract = {Neuronal activity must be tightly coordinated with blood flow to keep proper brain function, which is achieved by a mechanism known as neurovascular coupling. Then, an increase in synaptic activity leads to a dilation of local parenchymal arterioles that matches the enhanced metabolic demand. Neurovascular coupling is orchestrated by astrocytes. These glial cells are located between neurons and the microvasculature, with the astrocytic endfeet ensheathing the vessels, which allows fine intercellular communication. The neurotransmitters released during neuronal activity reach astrocytic receptors and trigger a Ca(2+) signaling that propagates to the endfeet, activating the release of vasoactive factors and arteriolar dilation. The astrocyte Ca(2+) signaling is coordinated by gap junction channels and hemichannels formed by connexins (Cx43 and Cx30) and channels formed by pannexins (Panx-1). The neuronal activity-initiated Ca(2+) waves are propagated among neighboring astrocytes directly via gap junctions or through ATP release via connexin hemichannels or pannexin channels. In addition, Ca(2+) entry via connexin hemichannels or pannexin channels may participate in the regulation of the astrocyte signaling-mediated neurovascular coupling. Interestingly, nitric oxide (NO) can activate connexin hemichannel by S-nitrosylation and the Ca(2+)-dependent NO-synthesizing enzymes endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and neuronal NOS (nNOS) are expressed in astrocytes. Therefore, the astrocytic Ca(2+) signaling triggered in neurovascular coupling may activate NO production, which, in turn, may lead to Ca(2+) influx through hemichannel activation. Furthermore, NO release from the hemichannels located at astrocytic endfeet may contribute to the vasodilation of parenchymal arterioles. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms involved in the regulation of the astrocytic Ca(2+) signaling that mediates neurovascular coupling, with a special emphasis in the possible participation of NO in this process.},

abstract = {ATP is an extracellular signaling molecule that activates specific G protein-coupled P2Y receptors in most cell types to mediate diverse biological effects. ATP has been shown to activate the phospholipase C (PLC)/diacylglycerol/protein kinase C (PKC) pathway in various systems. However, little is known about the signaling events in human endometrial stromal cells (hESCs). The objective of this study was to examine the presence of the P2Y2 receptor and the effects of exogenous ATP on the intracellular mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathway, immediate early genes expression, and cell viability in hESCs. Western blot analysis, gene array analysis, and MTT assay for cell viability were performed. The current study demonstrated the existence of the P2Y2 purinergic receptor in hESCs. UTP and ATP activated MAPK in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Suramin (a P2-purinoceptor antagonist), neomycin (a PLC inhibitor), staurosporin (a PKC inhibitor), and PD98059 (a MEK inhibitor) significantly attenuated the ATP-induced activation of MAPK. ATP activated ERK1/2 and induced translocation of activated ERK1/2 to the nucleus. The gene array for 23 genes associated with members of the mitogenic pathway cascade and immediate early genes revealed that the expression of early growth response 1 was increased. In addition, MTT assay revealed an inhibition effect of ATP on cell viability. ATP activated MAPKs through the P2Y2 purinoceptor/PLC/PKC/ERK signaling pathway and induced translocation of ERK1/2 into the nucleus. Further, ATP induced the expression of early growth response 1 and inhibited cell viability in hESCs. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

A{\$}\beta{\$}(25-35) resulted in significantly decreased nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and endothelial NOS protein expression, but increased arginase activity, arginase II protein expression, and ornithine and putrescine levels, in hippocampal CA2/3. There were increased glutamate and putrescine levels in the DG, but decreased agmatine levels in the DG and PFC, in the A{\$}\beta{\$}(25-35) group relative to the A{\$}\beta{\$}(35-25) one. Cluster analyses were performed to determine if the nine related neurochemical variables (arginine, citrulline, ornithine, agmatine, putrescine, spermidine, spemine, glutamate, and GABA) formed distinct groups, and whether it changed as a function of A{\$}\beta{\$}(25-35). There were substantially different clusters between the two groups in the hippocampus and PFC. These results demonstrate that A{\$}\beta{\$}(25-35) alters arginine metabolism, which further supports the prominent role of arginine and its metabolites in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Neuronal activity, astrocytic responses to this activity, and energy homeostasis are linked together during baseline, conscious conditions, and short-term rapid activation (as occurs with sensory or motor function). Nervous system energy homeostasis also varies during long-term physiological conditions (i.e., development and aging) and with adaptation to pathological conditions, such as ischemia or low glucose. Neuronal activation requires increased metabolism (i.e., ATP generation) which leads initially to substrate depletion, induction of a variety of signals for enhanced astrocytic function, and increased local blood flow and substrate delivery. Energy generation (particularly in mitochondria) and use during ATP hydrolysis also lead to considerable heat generation. The local increases in blood flow noted following neuronal activation can both enhance local substrate delivery but also provides a heat sink to help cool the brain and removal of waste by-products. In this review we highlight the interactions between short-term neuronal activity and energy metabolism with an emphasis on signals and factors regulating astrocyte function and substrate supply.},

Emerging evidence implicates astrocytes as one of the key players in coordinating this neurovascular coupling. Astrocytes are poised to sense glutamatergic synaptic activity over a large spatial domain via activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors and subsequent calcium signaling and via energy-dependent glutamate transport. Astrocyte foot processes can signal vascular smooth muscle by arachidonic acid pathways involving astrocytic cytochrome P450 epoxygenase, astrocytic cyclooxygenase-1 and smooth muscle cytochrome P450 ??-hydroxylase activities, and by astrocytic and smooth muscle potassium channels. Non-glutamatergic transmitters released from neurons, such as nitric oxide, cyclooxygenase-2 metabolites and vasoactive intestinal peptide, might modulate neurovascular signaling at the level of the astrocyte or smooth muscle. Thus, astrocytes have a pivotal role in dynamic signaling within the neurovascular unit.

abstract = {The intercellular synchronization of spontaneous calcium (Ca(2+)) oscillations in individual smooth muscle cells is a prerequisite for vasomotion. A detailed mathematical model of Ca(2+) dynamics in rat mesenteric arteries shows that a number of synchronizing and desynchronizing pathways may be involved. In particular, Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipase C, the intercellular diffusion of inositol trisphosphate (IP(3), and to a lesser extent Ca(2+)), IP(3) receptors, diacylglycerol-activated nonselective cation channels, and Ca(2+)-activated chloride channels can contribute to synchronization, whereas large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated potassium channels have a desynchronizing effect. Depending on the contractile state and agonist concentrations, different pathways become predominant, and can be revealed by carefully inhibiting the oscillatory component of their total activity. The phase shift between the Ca(2+) and membrane potential oscillations can change, and thus electrical coupling through gap junctions can mediate either synchronization or desynchronization. The effect of the endothelium is highly variable because it can simultaneously enhance the intercellular coupling and affect multiple smooth muscle cell components. Here, we outline a system of increased complexity and propose potential synchronization mechanisms that need to be experimentally tested.},

abstract = {Purinergic signaling plays important roles in control of vascular tone and remodeling. There is dual control of vascular tone by ATP released as a cotransmitter with noradrenaline from perivascular sympathetic nerves to cause vasoconstriction via P2X1 receptors, whereas ATP released from endothelial cells in response to changes in blood flow (producing shear stress) or hypoxia acts on P2X and P2Y receptors on endothelial cells to produce nitric oxide and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, which dilates vessels. ATP is also released from sensory-motor nerves during antidromic reflex activity to produce relaxation of some blood vessels. In this review, we stress the differences in neural and endothelial factors in purinergic control of different blood vessels. The long-term (trophic) actions of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides and nucleotides in promoting migration and proliferation of both vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells via P1 and P2Y receptors during angiogenesis and vessel remodeling during restenosis after angioplasty are described. The pathophysiology of blood vessels and therapeutic potential of purinergic agents in diseases, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, ischemia, thrombosis and stroke, diabetes, and migraine, is discussed.},

abstract = {The oxygen exchange and correlation between the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) in the cortical capillary levels for normal and pathologic brain functions remain the subject of debate. A 3D realistic mesoscale model of the cortical capillary network (non-tree like) is constructed using a random Voronoi tessellation in which each edge represents a capillary segment. The hemodynamics and oxygen transport are numerically simulated in the model, which involves rheological laws in the capillaries, oxygen diffusion, and non-linear binding of oxygen to hemoglobin, respectively. The findings show that the cerebral hypoxia due to a significant decreased perfusion (as can occur in stroke) can be avoided by a moderate reduction in oxygen demand. Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) can be an important indicator for the brain oxygen metabolism under normal perfusion and misery-perfusion syndrome (leading to ischemia). The results demonstrated that a disproportionately large increase in blood supply is required for a small increase in the oxygen demand, which, in turn, is strongly dependent on the resting OEF. The predicted flow-metabolism coupling in the model supports the experimental studies of spatiotemporal stimulations in humans by positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging.},

@article{Kanai1995,
abstract = {Shear stress causes the vascular endothelium to release nitric oxide (NO), which is an important regulator of vascular tone. However, direct measurement of NO release after the imposition of laminar flow has not been previously accomplished because of chemical (oxidative degradation) and physical (diffusion, convection, and washout) complications. Consequently, the mechanism, time course, kinetics, and Ca2+ dependence of NO release due to shear stress remain incompletely understood. In this study, we characterized these parameters by using fura 2 fluorescence and a polymeric porphyrin/Nafion-coated carbon fiber microsensor (detection limit, 5 nmol/L; response time, 1 millisecond) to directly measure changes in [Ca2+], and NO release due to shear stress or agonist (ATP or brominated Ca2+ ionophore [Br-A23187]) from bovine aortic endothelial cells. The cells were grown to confluence on glass coverslips, loaded with fura 2-AM, and mounted in a parallel-plate flow chamber (volume, 25 $\mu$L). The microsensor was positioned ≃100 $\mu$m above the cells with its long axis parallel to the direction of flow. Laminar flow of perfusate was maintained from 0.04 to 1.90 mL/min, which produced shear stresses of 0.2 to 10 dyne/cm2. Shear stress caused transient NO release 3 to 5 seconds after the initiation of flow and 1 to 3 seconds after the rise in [Ca2+](i), which reached a plateau after 35 to 70 seconds. Although the amount (peak rate) of NO release increased as a function of the shear stress (0.08 to 3.80 pmol/s), because of the concomitant increase in the flow rate, the peak NO concentration (133±9 nmol/L) remained constant. Maintenance of flow resulted in additional transient NO release, with peak-to-peak intervals of 15.5±2.5 minutes. During this 13- to 18-minute period, when the cells were unresponsive to shear stress, exogenous ATP (10 $\mu$mol/L) or Br-A23187 (10 $\mu$mol/L) evoked NO release. Prior incubation of the cells with exogenous NO or the removal and EGTA (100 $\mu$mol/L) chelation of extracellular Ca2+ blocked shear stress but not ATP-dependent NO release. The kinetics of shear stress-induced NO release (2.23±0.07 nmol/L per second) closely resembled the kinetics of Ca2+ flux but differed markedly from the kinetics of ATP-induced NO release (5.64±0.32 nmol/L per second). These data argue that shear stress causes a Ca2+- mediated ATP-independent transient release of NO, where the peak rate of release but not the peak concentration depends on the level of shear stress. The transient nature of this response may be due to NO-induced inhibition of Ca2+ influx via a mechanism yet to be determined.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous free radical that functions as an endogenous mediator in numerous tissues. Because NO is both reactive and highly diffusible, its formation must be tightly regulated to control its synthesis and to specify its signaling. Indeed, molecular studies of the NO synthase (NOS) family of enzymes have elaborated a variety of mechanisms, including protein interactions, lipid modifications and protein phosphorylation cascades that spatially and temporally control NO biosynthesis. These mechanisms determine both the upstream cellular signals that stimulate NO formation and the downstream molecular targets for NO. Understanding these cellular pathways that control NOS will help us to elucidate the functional roles of NO and provide novel strategies to treat diseases associated with NO abnormalities.},

The resulting "BVP model" has two variables of state, representing excitability and refractoriness, and qualitatively resembles Bonhoeffer's theoretical model for the iron wire model of nerve. This BVP model serves as a simple representative of a class of excitable-oscillatory systems including the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model of the squid giant axon. The BVP phase plane can be divided into regions corresponding to the physiological states of nerve fiber (resting, active, refractory, enhanced, depressed, etc.) to form a "physiological state diagram," with the help of which many physiological phenomena can be summarized. A properly chosen projection from the 4-dimensional HH phase space onto a plane produces a similar diagram which shows the underlying relationship between the two models. Impulse trains occur in the BVP and HH models for a range of constant applied currents which make the singular point representing the resting state unstable.},

abstract = {Intracellular Ca2+ signaling is considered to be important for multiple astrocyte functions in neural circuits. However, mice devoid of inositol triphosphate type 2 receptors (IP3R2) reportedly lack all astrocyte Ca2+ signaling, but display no neuronal or neurovascular deficits, implying that astrocyte Ca2+ fluctuations are not involved in these functions. An assumption has been that the loss of somatic Ca2+ fluctuations also reflects a similar loss in astrocyte processes. We tested this assumption and found diverse types of Ca2+ fluctuations in astrocytes, with most occurring in processes rather than in somata. These fluctuations were preserved in Ip3r2-/- (also known as Itpr2-/-) mice in brain slices and in vivo, occurred in end feet, and were increased by G protein-coupled receptor activation and by startle-induced neuromodulatory responses. Our data reveal previously unknown Ca2+ fluctuations in astrocytes and highlight limitations of studies that used Ip3r2-/- mice to evaluate astrocyte contributions to neural circuit function and mouse behavior.},

We present a detailed analysis of the intercellular wave in a two-dimensional sheet of cells. The model is based on the hypothesis that the wave is the result of diffusion of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) from the stimulated cell. The two-dimensional model agrees well with experimental data and makes the following quantitative predictions: as the distance from the stimulated cells increases, 1) the intercellular delay increases exponentially, 2) the intracellular wave speed decreases exponentially, and 3) the arrival time increases exponentially. Furthermore, 4) a proportion of the cells at the periphery of the response will exhibit waves of decreased amplitude, 5) the intercellular membrane permeability to IP3 must be approximately 2 microns/s or greater, and 6) the ratio of the maximum concentration of IP3 in the stimulated cell to the Km of the IP3 receptor (with respect to IP3) must be approximately 300 or greater. These predictions constitute a rigorous test of the hypothesis that the intercellular Ca2+ waves are mediated by IP3 diffusion.},

In addition, this line has a certain threshold value in respect to the signal height, and signals smaller than the threshold or noise are eliminated in the course of transmission.

abstract = {NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-gated cation channels with high calcium permeability that play important roles in many aspects of the biology of higher organisms. They are critical for the development of the central nervous system (CNS), generation of rhythms for breathing and locomotion, and the processes underlying learning, memory, and neuroplasticity. Consequently, abnormal expression levels and altered NMDAR function have been implicated in numerous neurological disorders and pathological conditions. NMDAR hypofunction can result in cognitive defects, whereas overstimulation causes excitotoxicity and subsequent neurodegeneration. Therefore, NMDARs are important therapeutic targets for many CNS disorders [1-8] including stroke, hypoxia, ischemia, head trauma, Huntington's, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's diseases, epilepsy, neuropathic pain, alcoholism, schizophrenia, and mood disorders. To date, drugs targeting NMDARs have had only limited success clinically due to poor efficacy and unacceptable side effects, including hallucinations, catatonia, ataxia, nightmares, and memory deficits. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying agonist-induced receptor activation would facilitate development of more selective drugs that target specific NMDAR subtypes and alter their function to a well-defined extent. This chapter will investigate the physiological roles NMDARs play in the mammalian nervous system and the molecular and structural basis of NMDAR activation. One of the main questions that will be addressed is how agonist binding results in opening of the NMDAR ion channel. Although the mechanism coupling ligand binding to channel opening remains incompletely understood for NMDARs, we propose that this process suggests promising approaches to drug design.},

In this study we assessed, for the first time, the differences in neuronal responses and changes in CBF and oxygen consumption that are evoked after the activation of two different inputs to a single cortical area. We show that, for a given level of glutamatergic synaptic activity, corticocortical and thalamocortical inputs evoked activity in pyramidal cells and different classes of interneurons, and produced different changes in oxygen consumption and CBF. Furthermore, increases in stimulation intensities either turned off or activated additional classes of inhibitory interneurons immunoreactive for different vasoactive molecules, which may contribute to increases in CBF. Our data imply that for a given cortical area, the amplitude of vascular signals will depend critically on the type of input, and that a positive blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal may be a consequence of the activation of both pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine whether nitric oxide (NO) is responsible for the vascular smooth muscle relaxation elicited by endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). EDRF is an unstable humoral substance released from artery and vein that mediates the action of endothelium-dependent vasodilators. NO is an unstable endothelium-independent vasodilator that is released from vasodilator drugs such as nitroprusside and glyceryl trinitrate. We have repeatedly observed that the actions of NO on vascular smooth muscle closely resemble those of EDRF. In the present study the vascular effects of EDRF released from perfused bovine intrapulmonary artery and vein were compared with the effects of NO delivered by superfusion over endothelium-denuded arterial and venous strips arranged in a cascade. EDRF was indistinguishable from NO in that both were labile (t1/2 = 3-5 sec), inactivated by pyrogallol or superoxide anion, stabilized by superoxide dismutase, and inhibited by oxyhemoglobin or potassium. Both EDRF and NO produced comparable increases in cyclic GMP accumulation in artery and vein, and this cyclic GMP accumulation was inhibited by pyrogallol, oxyhemoglobin, potassium, and methylene blue. EDRF was identified chemically as NO, or a labile nitroso species, by two procedures. First, like NO, EDRF released from freshly isolated aortic endothelial cells reacted with hemoglobin to yield nitrosylhemoglobin. Second, EDRF and NO each similarly promoted the diazotization of sulfanilic acid and yielded the same reaction product after coupling with N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine. Thus, EDRF released from artery and vein possesses identical biological and chemical properties as NO.},

abstract = {Migraine is a common, recurrent, and disabling primary headache disorder with a genetic component which affects up to 20{\%} of the population. One third of all patients with migraine experiences aura, a focal neurological disturbance that manifests itself as visual, sensitive or motor symptoms preceding the headache. In the pathophysiology of migraine with aura, activation of the trigeminovascular system from the meningeal vessels mediates migraine pain via the brainstem and projections ascend to the thalamus and cortex. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) was proposed to trigger migraine aura and to activate perivascular trigeminal nerves in the cortex. Quinine, quinidine and the derivative mefloquine are able to inhibit CSD suggesting an involvement of neuronal connexin36 channels in CSD propagation. More recently, CSD was shown to induce headache by activating the trigeminovascular system through the opening of stressed neuronal Pannexin1 channels. A novel benzopyran compound, tonabersat, was selected for clinical trial on the basis of its inhibitory activity on CSD and neurogenic inflammation in animal models of migraine. Interestingly, in the time course of animal model trials, tonabersat was shown to inhibit trigeminal ganglion (TGG) neuronal-glial cell gap junctions, suggesting that this compound could prevent peripheral sensitization within the ganglion. Three clinical trials aimed at investigating the effectiveness of tonabersat as a preventive drug were negative, and conflicting results were obtained in other trials concerning its ability to relieve attacks. In contrast, in another clinical trial, tonabersat showed a preventive effect on attacks of migraine with aura but had no efficacy on non-aura attacks. Gap junction channels seem to be involved in several ways in the pathophysiology of migraine with aura and emerge as a new promising putative target in treatment of this disorder.},

abstract = {Large-conductance Ca-activated potassium channels (BK channels) are uniquely sensitive to both membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+. Recent work has demonstrated that in the gating of these channels there are voltage-sensitive steps that are separate from Ca2+ binding steps. Based on this result and the macroscopic steady state and kinetic properties of the cloned BK channel mslo, we have recently proposed a general kinetic scheme to describe the interaction between voltage and Ca2+ in the gating of the mslo channel (Cui, J., D.H. Cox, and R.W. Aldrich. 1997. J. Gen. Physiol. In press.). This scheme supposes that the channel exists in two main conformations, closed and open. The conformational change between closed and open is voltage dependent. Ca2+ binds to both the closed and open conformations, but on average binds more tightly to the open conformation and thereby promotes channel opening. Here we describe the basic properties of models of this form and test their ability to mimic mslo macroscopic steady state and kinetic behavior. The simplest form of this scheme corresponds to a voltage-dependent version of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model of allosteric proteins. The success of voltage-dependent MWC models in describing many aspects of mslo gating suggests that these channels may share a common molecular mechanism with other allosteric proteins whose behaviors have been modeled using the MWC formalism. We also demonstrate how this scheme can arise as a simplification of a more complex scheme that is based on the premise that the channel is a homotetramer with a single Ca2+ binding site and a single voltage sensor in each subunit. Aspects of the mslo data not well fitted by the simplified scheme will likely be better accounted for by this more general scheme. The kinetic schemes discussed in this paper may be useful in interpreting the effects of BK channel modifications or mutations.},

abstract = {We used two-photon (2-p) F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy to provide serial, noninvasive measurements of [Ca(2+)] in arterioles of living "biosensor" mice. These express a genetically encoded Ca(2+) indicator (GECI), either FRET-based exMLCK or intensity-based GCaMP2. The FRET ratios, Rmin and Rmax, required for in vivo Ca(2+) calibration of exMLCK were obtained in isolated arteries. For in vivo experiments, mice were anesthetized (1.5{\%} isoflurane), and arterioles within a depilated ear were visualized through the intact skin (i.e., noninvasively), by 2-p excitation of exMLCK (at 820 nm) or GCaMP2 (at 920 nm). Spontaneous or agonist-evoked [Ca(2+)] transients in arteriolar smooth muscle cells were imaged (at 2 Hz) with both exMLCK and GCaMP2. To examine changes in arteriolar [Ca(2+)] that might accompany hypertension, five exMLCK mice were implanted with telemetric blood pressure transducers and osmotic minipumps containing ANG II (350 ng{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1){\textperiodcentered}min(-1)) and fed a high (6{\%})-salt diet for 9 days. [Ca(2+)] was measured every other day in five smooth muscle cells of two to three arterioles in each animal. Prior to ANG II/salt, [Ca(2+)] was 246 ± 42 nM. [Ca(2+)] increased transiently to 599 nM on day 2 after beginning ANG II/salt, then remained elevated at 331 ± 42 nM for 4 more days, before returning to 265 ± 47 nM 6 days after removal of ANG II/salt. In summary, two-photon excitation of exMLCK and GCaMP2 provides a method for noninvasive, longitudinal quantification of [Ca(2+)] dynamics and vascular structure in individual arterioles of a particular animal over an extended period of time, a capability that should enhance future studies of hypertension and vascular function.},

In particular it is shown that networks of spiking neurons are, with regard to the number of neurons that are needed, computationally more powerful than these other neural network models. A concrete biologically relevant function is exhibited which can be computed by a single spiking neuron (for biologically reasonable values of its parameters), but which requires hundreds of hidden units on a sigmoidal neural net. On the other hand, it is known that any function that can be computed by a small sigmoidal neural net can also be computed by a small network of spiking neurons. This article does not assume prior knowledge about spiking neurons, and it contains an extensive list of references to the currently available literature on computations in networks of spiking neurons and relevant results from neurobiology.},

abstract = {A large body of evidence has appeared over the last 6 years suggesting that nitric oxide biosynthesis is a key factor in the pathophysiological response of the brain to hypoxia-ischemia. Whilst studies on the influence of nitric oxide in this phenomenon initially offered conflicting conclusions, the use of better biochemical tools, such as selective inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms or transgenic animals, is progressively clarifying the precise role of nitric oxide in brain ischemia. Brain ischemia triggers a cascade of events, possibly mediated by excitatory amino acids, yielding the activation of the Ca2+-dependent NOS isoforms, i.e. neuronal NOS (nNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS). However, whereas the selective inhibition of nNOS is neuroprotective, selective inhibition of eNOS is neurotoxic. Furthermore, mainly in glial cells, delayed ischemia or reperfusion after an ischemic episode induces the expression of Ca2+-independent inducible NOS (iNOS), and its selective inhibition is neuroprotective. In conclusion, it appears that activation of nNOS or induction of iNOS mediates ischemic brain damage, possibly by mitochondrial dysfunction and energy depletion. However, there is a simultaneous compensatory response through eNOS activation within the endothelium of blood vessels, which mediates vasodilation and hence increases blood flow to the damaged brain area.

abstract = {The goal of the present study is to construct a biophysical model of the coronary artery endothelial cell response to bradykinin. This model takes into account intracellular Ca2+ dynamics, membrane potential, a non-selective cation channel, and two Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels, as well as intra- and extracellular Ca2+ sources. The model reproduces the experimental data available, and predicts certain quantities which would be hard to obtain experimentally, like the individual K+ channel currents when the membrane potential is allowed to freely evolve, the implication of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), and the total K+ released during stimulation. The main results are: (1) the large-conductance K+ channel participates only very little in the overall response; (2) EETs are required in order to explain the experimental current-potential relationships, but are not an essential component of the bradykinin response; and (3) the total K+ released during stimulation gives rise to a concentration in the intercellular space which is of millimolar order. This concentration change is compatible with the hypothesis that K+ contributes to the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor phenomenon.},

abstract = {A cell culture model of blood-brain barrier (BBB, coculture of rat brain endothelial cells with rat astrocytes) was used to investigate the effect of nitric oxide (.NO) on the damage of the BBB induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). Permeability coefficient of fluorescein across the endothelium was used as a marker of BBB tightness. The permeability coefficient increased 5.2 times after H/R indicating strong disruption of the BBB. The presence of the .NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP, 30 microM), authentic .NO (6 microM) or superoxide dismutase (50 units/ml) during H/R attenuated H/R-induced increase in permeability. 30 microM SNAP or 6 microM .NO did not influence the function of BBB during normoxia, however, severe disruption was observed using 150 microM of SNAP and more than 24 microM of .NO. After H/R of endothelial cells, the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) increased 2.3 times indicating radical-induced peroxidation of membrane lipids. 30 microM SNAP or 6 microM authentic .NO completely prevented MDA formation. The results show that .NO may effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species formed during H/R of brain capillary endothelial cells, affording protection of BBB at the molecular and functional level.},

abstract = {Calcium-dependent release of vasoactive gliotransmitters is widely assumed to trigger vasodilation associated with rapid increases in neuronal activity. Inconsistent with this hypothesis, intact stimulus-induced vasodilation was observed in inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) type-2 receptor (R2) knock-out (KO) mice, in which the primary mechanism of astrocytic calcium increase-the release of calcium from intracellular stores following activation of an IP3-dependent pathway-is lacking. Further, our results in wild-type (WT) mice indicate that in vivo onset of astrocytic calcium increase in response to sensory stimulus could be considerably delayed relative to the simultaneously measured onset of arteriolar dilation. Delayed calcium increases in WT mice were observed in both astrocytic cell bodies and perivascular endfeet. Thus, astrocytes may not play a role in the initiation of blood flow response, at least not via calcium-dependent mechanisms. Moreover, an increase in astrocytic intracellular calcium was not required for normal vasodilation in the IP3R2-KO animals.},

abstract = {Production of NO from arginine and molecular oxygen is a complex chemical reaction unique to biology. Our understanding of the chemical and regulation mechanisms of the NO synthases has developed over the past two decades, uncovering some extraordinary features. This article reviews recent progress and highlights current issues and controversies. The structure of the enzyme has now been determined almost in entirety, although it is as a selection of fragments, which are difficult to assemble unambiguously. NO synthesis is driven by electron transfer through FAD and FMN cofactors, which is controlled by calmodulin binding in the constitutive mammalian enzymes. Many of the unique structural features involved have been characterised, but the mechanics of calmodulin-dependent activation are largely unresolved. Ultimately, NO is produced in the active site by the reaction of arginine with activated heme-bound oxygen in two distinct cycles. The unique role of the tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor as an electron donor in this process has now been established, but the subsequent chemical events are currently a matter of intense speculation and debate. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Bifurcation mechanisms involved in the generation of action potentials (spikes) by neurons are reviewed here. We show how the type of bifurcation determines the neuro-computational properties of the cells. For example, when the rest state is near a saddle-node bifurcation, the cell can fire all-or-none spikes with an arbitrary low frequency, it has a well-defined threshold manifold, and it acts as an integrator; i.e. the higher the frequency of incoming pulses, the sooner it fires. In contrast, when the rest state is near an Andronov–Hopf bifurcation, the cell fires in a certain frequency range, its spikes are not all-or-none, it does not have a well-defined threshold manifold, it can fire in response to an inhibitory pulse, and it acts as a resonator; i.e. it responds preferentially to a certain (resonant) frequency of the input. Increasing the input frequency may actually delay or terminate its firing. We also describe the phenomenon of neural bursting, and we use geometric bifurcation theory to extend ...},

@article{Eliasson1999,
abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is a new intercellular messenger that occurs naturally in the brain without causing overt toxicity. Yet, NO has been implicated as a mediator of cell death in cell death. One explanation is that ischemia causes overproduction of NO, allowing it to react with superoxide to form the potent oxidant peroxynitrite. To address this question, we used immunohistochemistry for citrulline, a marker for NO synthase activity, and 3-nitrotyrosine, a marker for peroxynitrite formation, in mice subjected to reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion. We show that ischemia triggers a marked augmentation in citrulline immunoreactivity but more so in the peri-infarct than the infarcted tissue. This increase is attributable to the activation of a large population (approximately 80{\%}) of the neuronal isoform of NO synthase (nNOS) that is catalytically inactive during basal conditions, indicating a tight regulation of physiological NO production in the brain. In contrast, 3-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity is restricted to the infarcted tissue and is not present in the peri-infarct tissue. In nNOS(Delta/Delta) mice, known to be protected against ischemia, no 3-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity is detected. Our findings provide a cellular localization for nNOS activation in association with ischemic stroke and establish that NO is not likely a direct neurotoxin, whereas its conversion to peroxynitrite is associated with cell death.},

We report that transgenic mice overexpressing APP and Abeta have a profound attenuation in the increase in neocortical blood flow elicited by somatosensory activation. The impairment is highly correlated with brain Abeta concentration and is reproduced in normal mice by topical neocortical application of exogenous Abeta1-40 but not Abeta1-42. Overexpression of M146L mutant presenilin-1 in APP mice enhances the production of Abeta1-42 severalfold, but it does not produce a commensurate attenuation of the hyperemic response. APP and Abeta overexpression do not diminish the intensity of neural activation, as reflected by the increase in somatosensory cortex glucose usage. Thus, Abeta-induced alterations in functional hyperemia produce a potentially deleterious mismatch between substrate delivery and energy demands imposed by neural activity.},

abstract = {Sustained inward currents in neuronal membranes underlie tonic-clonic seizure discharges and spreading depression (SD). It is not known whether these currents flow through abnormally operating physiological ion channels or through pathological pathways that are not normally present. We have now used the NEURON simulating environment of Hines, Moore, and Carnevale to model seizure discharges and SD. The geometry and electrotonic properties of the model neuron conformed to a hippocampal pyramidal cell. Voltage-controlled transient and persistent sodium currents (I(Na,T) and I(Na,P)), potassium currents (I(K,DR) and I(K,A)), and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-controlled currents (I(NMDA)), were inserted in the appropriate regions of the model cell. The neuron was surrounded by an interstitial space where extracellular potassium and sodium concentration ([K(+)](o) and [Na(+)](o)) could rise or fall. Changes in intra- and extracellular ion concentrations and the resulting shifts in the driving force for ionic currents were continuously computed based on the amount of current flowing through the membrane. A Na-K exchange pump operated to restore ion balances. In addition, extracellular potassium concentration, [K(+)](o), was also controlled by a "glial" uptake function. Parameters were chosen to resemble experimental data. As long as [K(+)](o) was kept within limits by the activity of the Na-K pump and the "glial" uptake, a depolarizing current pulse applied to the cell soma evoked repetitive firing that ceased when the stimulating current stopped. If, however, [K(+)](o) was allowed to rise, then a brief pulse provoked firing that outlasted the stimulus. At the termination of such a burst, the cell hyperpolarized and then slowly depolarized and another burst erupted without outside intervention. Such "clonic" bursting could continue indefinitely maintained by an interplay of the rise and fall of potassium and sodium concentrations with membrane currents and threshold levels. SD-like depolarization could be produced in two ways, 1) by a dendritic NMDA-controlled current. Glutamate was assumed to be released in response to rising [K(+)](o). And 2) by the persistent (i.e., slowly inactivating) Na-current, I(Na,P). When both I(NMDA) and I(Na,P) were present, the two acted synergistically. We conclude that epileptiform neuronal behavior and SD-like depolarization can be generated by the feedback of ion currents that change ion concentrations, which, in turn, influence ion currents and membrane potentials. The normal stability of brain function must depend on the efficient control of ion activities, especially that of [K(+)](o).},

abstract = {Low nanomolar concentrations of nitric oxide activate guanylyl cyclase to produce cGMP, which has diverse physiological effects. Higher concentrations inhibit mitochondrial respiration at cytochrome c oxidase and this has been proposed to be important physiologically, increasing oxygen permeation into tissue (by reducing the oxygen use of cells near blood vessels), activating AMP kinase, and regulating the relationship between cerebral blood flow and oxygen use. It is unclear, however, whether nitric oxide can accumulate physiologically to concentrations at which inhibition of respiration occurs. In rat cerebellar slices, we activated nitric oxide production from each isoform of nitric oxide synthase. Only activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase, which is expressed pathologically, caused any significant inhibition of respiration. Modelling oxygen and nitric oxide concentrations predicted that, in vivo, physiological nitric oxide levels are too low to affect respiration. Even pathologically, the nitric oxide concentration may only rise to 2.5 nm, producing a 1.5{\%} inhibition of respiration. Thus, under physiological conditions, nitric oxide signals do not inhibit respiration but are well-tuned to the dynamic range of guanylyl cyclase activation.},

abstract = {Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and oxygen species (ROS) have been reported to modulate the function of nitric oxide synthase (NOS); however, the precise dose-dependent effects of specific RNS and ROS on NOS function are unknown. Questions remain unanswered regarding whether pathophysiological levels of RNS and ROS alter NOS function, and if this alteration is reversible. We measured the effects of peroxynitrite (ONOO-), superoxide (O2{\textperiodcentered} -), hydroxyl radical (.OH), and H2O2 on nNOS activity. The results showed that NO production was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by all four oxidants, but only O2{\textperiodcentered} - and ONOO- were inhibitory at pathophysiological concentrations (≤50 $\mu$M). Subsequent addition of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) fully restored activity after O2{\textperiodcentered} - exposure, while BH4 partially rescued the activity decrease induced by the other three oxidants. Furthermore, treatment with either ONOO- or O2{\textperiodcentered} - stimulated nNOS uncoupling with decreased NO and enhanced O2{\textperiodcentered} - generation. Thus, nNOS is reversibly uncoupled by O2{\textperiodcentered} - (≤50 $\mu$M), but irreversibly uncoupled and inactivated by ONOO-. Additionally, we observed that the mechanism by which oxidative stress alters nNOS activity involves not only BH4 oxidation, but also nNOS monomerization as well as possible degradation of the heme. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Equilibrium dialysis measurements of the binding of Ca2+ to calmodulin have confirmed the existence of four high affinity Ca2+-binding sites (Kd between 3 X 10(-6) and 2 X 10(-5) M). In the presence of 3 mM Mg2+, the dissociation constants for Ca2+ are increased two- to fourfold (Kd between 5 X 10(-6) and 4 X 10(-5) M). Positive cooperativity of Ca2+ binding was observed at low Ca2+ concentrations with Hill coefficients of 1.33 and 1.22 in the absence and presence of 3 mM Mg2+, respectively. The positive cooperativity is compatible with the steepness of the Ca2+ dependence of the conformational transition associated with the binding of 2 mol of Ca2+/mol of calmodulin. This conformational change, which affects the environment of the aromatic residues of calmodulin as measured by UV absorption and near-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy, is not the result of a monomer-dimer equilibrium mediated by Ca2+. Binding of Ca2+ to calmodulin is believed to occur by a sequential mechanism generating at least four different conformers of the protein and its free and liganded states. Even though the major conformational change is almost complete upon binding of 2 mol of Ca2+/mol of calmodulin, the activation of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase measured in the presence of limiting concentrations of calmodulin suggests that a calmodulin Ca3-42+ complex is required for interaction of calmodulin with the enzyme. As expected, on the basis of the strong affinity of the enzyme for the calmodulin x Ca2+ complex (Kd = 1-3 X 10(-9) M), the Ca2+ dependence of phosphodiesterase activation is highly cooperative and leads to a sharp threshold of Ca2+ concentration for control of enzyme activity.},

A central autoregulation mechanism observed in this unit is functional hyperemia, in which the microvasculature dilates in response to local neural activity in order to meet the increased demand for blood flow and oxygen. We have developed the first interactional model of bidirectional signaling in the neurovascular unit. The vascular model includes a description of vasomotion, the vascular oscillatory response to transmural pressure, observed in vivo. The communication mechanisms in the model include neural synaptic glutamate and potassium signaling to the astrocytes, potassium signaling from the astrocyte to the microvasculature, and astrocytic mechanosensation of vascular changes. The model response of the astrocyte to arteriolar dilation is validated with recent in vivo and in vitro experimental results. The model reproduces for the first time the in vitro observed phenomenon in which arteriole radius and Ca(2+) oscillations, "vasomotion," are damped due to neural induced astrocytic signaling.},

abstract = {Endothelial-derived nitric oxide (NO) is classically viewed as a regulator of vasomotor tone. NO plays an important role in regulating O(2) delivery through paracrine control of vasomotor tone locally and cardiovascular and respiratory responses centrally. Very soon after the cloning and functional characterization of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), studies on the interaction between O(2) and NO made the paradoxical finding that hypoxia led to decreases in eNOS expression and function. Why would decreases in O(2) content in tissues elicit a loss of a potent endothelial-derived vasodilator? We now know that restricting our view of NO as a regulator of vasomotor tone or blood pressure limited deeper levels of mechanistic insight. Exciting new studies indicate that functional interactions between NO and O(2) exhibit profound complexity and are relevant to diseases states, especially those associated with hypoxia in tissues. NOS isoforms catalytically require O(2). Hypoxia regulates steady-state expression of the mRNA and protein abundance of the NOS enzymes. Animals genetically deficient in NOS isoforms have perturbations in their ability to adapt to changes in O(2) supply or demand. Most interestingly, the intracellular pathways for O(2) sensing that evolved to ensure an appropriate balance of O(2) delivery and utilization intersect with NO signaling networks. Recent studies demonstrate that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) stabilization and transcriptional activity is achieved through two parallel pathways: (1) a decrease in O(2)-dependent prolyl hydroxylation of HIF and (2) S-nitrosylation of HIF pathway components. Recent findings support a role for S-nitrosothiols as hypoxia-mimetics in certain biological and/or disease settings, such as living at high altitude, exposure to small molecules that can bind NO, or anemia.},

abstract = {It is has been suggested that decreased production of the vasodilatory and anti-aggregative substance NO (nitric oxide) may result in lower cerebral blood flow (CBF) in injured areas of the traumatized brain. The NO-precursor l-arginine has been shown to counteract CBF decreases early after trauma, but microcirculatory and more long-term effects on CBF of l-arginine have not been investigated. In an attempt to analyze effects of l-arginine on the microcirculation in the traumatized brain, the present study was designed to evaluate the effects of l-arginine compared to vehicle (0.9{\%} saline) following a standardized controlled cortical-impact brain trauma in mice. Cerebral blood flow (autoradiography [14C]-iodoantipyrine), number of perfused capillaries (FITC-dextran fluorescence technique), brain water content (wet vs. dry weight) and the blood to brain transfer constant Ki for [51Cr]-EDTA were analyzed in the injured and the contralateral cortex. Cortical blood flow in the injured cortex was 0.43 ?? 0.3??mL/g/min and 0.81 ?? 0.3??mL/g/min 3??h after trauma in the vehicle and l-arginine groups, respectively (p {\textless} 0.05), and no treatment effect was seen 24??h after trauma. The number of perfused capillaries decreased following trauma and was unaffected by l-arginine. Ki increased following trauma and was unaffected by l-arginine. Brain water content was lower in the l-arginine group than in the vehicle group 3??h after trauma and there was no difference between the groups 24??h after trauma. We conclude that l-arginine reduces brain edema formation and improves cortical blood flow in the early phase after a brain trauma, whereas no circulatory effects can be seen after prolonged treatment. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Numerical simulations of unsteady blood flow through a honeycomb network originating at multiple inlets and terminating at multiple outlets are presented and discussed under the assumption that blood behaves as a continuum with variable constitution. Unlike a tree network, the honeycomb network exhibits both diverging and converging bifurcations between branching capillary segments. Numerical results based on a finite difference method demonstrate that as in the case of tree networks considered in previous studies, the cell partitioning law at diverging bifurcations is an important parameter in both steady and unsteady flow. Specifically, a steady flow may spontaneously develop self-sustained oscillations at critical conditions by way of a Hopf bifurcation. Contrary to tree-like networks comprised entirely of diverging bifurcations, the critical parameters for instability in honeycomb networks depend weakly on the system size. The blockage of one or more network segments due to the presence of large cells or the occurrence of capillary constriction may cause flow reversal or trigger a transition to unsteady flow.},

abstract = {We have developed a minimum kinetic model for cross-bridge interactions with the thin filament in smooth muscle. The model hypothesizes two types of cross-bridge interactions: 1) cycling phosphorylated cross bridges and 2) noncycling dephosphorylated cross bridges ("latch bridges"). The major assumptions are that 1) Ca2+-dependent myosin phosphorylation is the only postulated regulatory mechanism, 2) each myosin head acts independently, and 3) latch bridges are formed by dephosphorylation of an attached cross bridge. Rate constants were resolved by fitting data on the time courses of myosin phosphorylation and stress development. Comparison of the rate constants indicates that latch-bridge detachment is the rate-limiting step. Model simulations predicted a hyperbolic dependence of steady-state stress on myosin phosphorylation, which corresponded with the experimental observation of high values of stress with low levels of phosphorylation in intact tissues. Model simulations also predicted the experimental observation that an initial phosphorylation transient only accelerates stress development, with no effect on the final steady-state levels of stress. Because the only Ca2+-dependent regulatory mechanism in this model was activation of myosin light chain kinase, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that myosin phosphorylation is both necessary and sufficient for the development of the latch state.},

abstract = {SUNDIALS is a suite of advanced computational codes for solving large-scale problems that can be modeled as a system of nonlinear algebraic equations, or as initial-value problems in ordinary differential or differential-algebraic equations. The basic versions of these codes are called KINSOL, CVODE, and IDA, respectively. The codes are written in ANSI standard C and are suitable for either serial or parallel machine environments. Common and notable features of these codes include inexact Newton-Krylov methods for solving large-scale nonlinear systems; linear multistep methods for time-dependent problems; a highly modular structure to allow incorporation of different preconditioning and/or linear solver methods; and clear interfaces allowing for users to provide their own data structures underneath the solvers. We describe the current capabilities of the codes, along with some of the algorithms and heuristics used to achieve efficiency and robustness. We also describe how the codes stem from previous and widely used Fortran 77 solvers, and how the codes have been augmented with forward and adjoint methods for carrying out first-order sensitivity analysis with respect to model parameters or initial conditions.},

abstract = {Horizontal cells send inhibitory feedback to photoreceptors, helping form antagonistic receptive fields in the retina, but the neurotransmitter and the mechanisms underlying this signalling are not known. Since the proteins responsible for conventional Ca(2+)-dependent release of GABAergic synaptic vesicles are present in mammalian horizontal cells, we investigated this conventional mechanism as the means by which horizontal cells inhibit photoreceptors. Using Ca(2+) imaging in rat retinal slices, we confirm that horizontal cell depolarization with kainate inhibits and horizontal cell hyperpolarization with NBQX disinhibits the Ca(2+) signals produced by pH-sensitive activation of voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca channels) in photoreceptors. We show that while 100 $\mu$m Co(2+) reduces photoreceptor Ca(2+) signals, it disinhibits them at 10 $\mu$m, an effect reminiscent of earlier studies where low [Co(2+)] eliminated feedback. The low [Co(2+)] disinhibition is pH sensitive. We localized L-, N- and P/Q-type Ca channels in rat horizontal cells, and showed that both the N-type Ca channel blocker -conotoxin GVIA and the P/Q-type Ca channel blocker -agatoxin IVA increased Ca(2+) signals in photoreceptors in a pH-sensitive manner. Pronounced actions of GABAergic agents on feedback signals to photoreceptors were observed, and are pH sensitive, but are inconsistent with direct inhibition by GABA of photoreceptor [Ca(2+)]. Patch-clamp studies revealed that GABA activates a conductance having high bicarbonate permeability in isolated horizontal cells, suggesting that the commonality of pH sensitivity throughout the results could arise from a GABA autofeedback action in horizontal cells. This could change cleft pH with concomitant inhibitory influences on photoreceptor Ca channels.},

abstract = {Neurovascular coupling in response to stimulation of the rat barrel cortex was investigated using concurrent multichannel electrophysiology and laser Doppler flowmetry. The data were used to build a linear dynamic model relating neural activity to blood flow. Local field potential time series were subject to current source density analysis, and the time series of a layer IV sink of the barrel cortex was used as the input to the model. The model output was the time series of the changes in regional cerebral blood flow (CBF). We show that this model can provide excellent fit of the CBF responses for stimulus durations of up to 16 s. The structure of the model consisted of two coupled components representing vascular dilation and constriction. The complex temporal characteristics of the CBF time series were reproduced by the relatively simple balance of these two components. We show that the impulse response obtained under the 16-s duration stimulation condition generalised to provide a good prediction to the data from the shorter duration stimulation conditions. Furthermore, by optimising three out of the total of nine model parameters, the variability in the data can be well accounted for over a wide range of stimulus conditions. By establishing linearity, classic system analysis methods can be used to generate and explore a range of equivalent model structures (e.g., feed-forward or feedback) to guide the experimental investigation of the control of vascular dilation and constriction following stimulation. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {During saccadic motion the eyewall moves in a manner similar to a sinusoid or at least can be represented by a sine Fourier series. Motion of the vitreous is induced by the saccade and the vitreo-retinal interface is subjected to a time-dependent shear. This force may be a significant factor for retinal tearing in the neighbourhood of small retinal holes or tears. An analytical viscoelastic model and a numerical, Newtonian model of the motion of the vitreous are presented and compared. Under sinusoidal boundary motion the analytical model shows that a viscous wave propagates inward toward the axis of rotation and the characteristic length of this wave is a function of the Womersley number. The numerical solution indicates that the vitreous moves similarly to the analytical result with small secondary motion; however, this motion allows complete recirculation of the vitreous over large timescales. Excellent agreement is found between the analytical and numerical models. The time-dependent fluid shear is evaluated and from the analytical solution the maximum value of this is found to be proportional to R0 square root of v(omega)3, where R0 is the eye radius, v the modified complex viscosity and omega the sinusoidal frequency. This indicates that myopes have a larger shear force exerted on them by virtue of the larger eye size. Further work is directed toward a model which links the stress found in the sclera to that exerted on the vitreo-retinal interface by the vitreous fluid motion.},

abstract = {Flow-induced production of nitric oxide (NO) by endothelial cells plays a fundamental role in vascular homeostasis. However, the mechanisms by which shear stress activates NO production remain unclear due in part to limitations in measuring NO, especially under flow conditions. Shear stress elicits the release of ATP, but the relative contribution of autocrine stimulation by ATP to flow-induced NO production has not been established. Furthermore, the importance of calcium in shear stress-induced NO production remains controversial, and in particular the role of capacitive calcium entry (CCE) has yet to be determined. We have utilized our unique NO measurement device to investigate the role of ATP autocrine signaling and CCE in shear stress-induced NO production. We found that endogenously released ATP and downstream activation of purinergic receptors and CCE plays a significant role in shear stress-induced NO production. ATP-induced eNOS phophorylation under static conditions is also dependent on CCE. Inhibition of protein kinase C significantly inhibited eNOS phosphorylation and the calcium response. To our knowledge, we are the first to report on the role of CCE in the mechanism of acute shear stress-induced NO response. In addition, our work highlights the importance of ATP autocrine signaling in shear stress-induced NO production.},

abstract = {In the brain, hundreds of intracellular processes are known to depend on calcium influx; hence any substantial fluctuation in external calcium ([Ca2+]o) is likely to engender important functional effects. Employing the known scales and parameters of mammalian neural tissue, we introduce and justify a computational approach to the hypothesis that large changes in local [Ca2+]o will be part of normal neural activity. Using this model, we show that the geometry of the extracellular space in combination with the rapid movement of calcium through ionic channels can cause large external calcium fluctuations, up to 100{\%} depletion in many cases. The exact magnitude of a calcium fluctuation will depend on 1) the size of the consumption zone, 2) the local diffusion coefficient of calcium, and 3) the geometrical arrangement of the consuming elements. Once we have shown that using biologically relevant parameters leads to calcium changes, we focus on the signaling capacity of such concentration fluctuations. Given the sensitivity of neurotransmitter release to [Ca2+]o, the exact position and timing of neural activity will delimit the terminals that are able to release neurotransmitter. Our results indicate that mammalian neural tissue is engineered to generate significant changes in external calcium concentrations during normal activity.

abstract = {We present a computational, biophysical model of neuron-astrocyte-vessel interaction. Unlike other cells, neurons convey "hunger" signals to the vascular network via an intervening layer of glial cells (astrocytes); vessels dilate and release glucose which fuels neuronal firing. Existing computational models focus on only parts of this loop (neuron→astrocyte→vessel→neuron), whereas the proposed model describes the entire loop. Neuronal firing causes release of a neurotransmitter like glutamate which triggers release of vasodilator by astrocytes via a cascade of biochemical events. Vasodilators released from astrocytic endfeet cause blood vessels to dilate and release glucose into the interstitium, part of which is taken up by the astrocyticendfeet. Glucose is converted into lactate in the astrocyte and transported into the neuron. Glucose from the interstitium and lactate (produced from glucose) influx from astrocyte are converted into ATP in the neuron. Neuronal ATP is used to drive the Na(+)/K(+)ATPase pumps, which maintain ionic gradients necessary for neuronal firing. When placed in the metabolic loop, the neuron exhibits sustained firing only when the stimulation current is more than a minimum threshold. For various combinations of initial neuronal [ATP] and external current, the neuron exhibits a variety of firing patterns including sustained firing, firing after an initial pause, burst firing etc. Neurovascular interactions under conditions of constricted vessels are also studied. Most models of cerebral circulation describe neurovascular interactions exclusively in the "forward" neuron→vessel direction. The proposed model indicates possibility of "reverse" influence also, with vasomotion rhythms influencing neural firing patterns. Another idea that emerges out of the proposed work is that brain's computations may be more comprehensively understood in terms of neuro-glial-vascular dynamics and not in terms of neural firing alone.},

Later on, several groups identified EDRF to be a gas, nitric oxide (NO). Since then, NO was identified as one of the most versatile and unique molecules in animal and human biology. Nitric oxide mediates a plethora of physiological functions, for example, maintenance of vascular tone and inflammation. Apart from these physiological functions, NO is also involved in the pathophysiology of various disorders, specifically those in which regulation of blood flow and inflammation has a key role. The aim of the current review is to summarize the role of NO in cerebral ischemia, the most common cause of stroke.},

abstract = {We describe a method for imaging the local cortical haemodynamic response to whisker stimulation in the rat without use of anaesthetic or paralytic agents. Female Hooded Lister rats were anaesthetised and a section of skull overlying somatosensory cortex thinned to translucency. A stainless steel chamber was then secured over the thin cranial window. Following recovery, animals were supported in a harness whilst the head was held by the implanted chamber using a pneumatically driven clamp. Optical imaging and optical imaging spectroscopy (OIS) of somatosensory cortex were performed whilst the contralateral whiskers were stimulated using a computer controlled air-puffer. Imaging sessions lasted approximately 15 min and data were collected for at least three consecutive days. Experiments were then repeated with the animals under urethane anaesthesia. Spectral analysis revealed qualitatively similar haemodynamic response functions across both anaesthetic states. However, our results indicate that the cortical haemodynamic response to somatosensory stimulation is larger by a factor of ∼5 in the unanaesthetised rat compared with the anaesthetised rat. This preparation may make possible the investigation of the haemodynamic correlates of a broad range of neurological processes in the awake, behaving rodent. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {1. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded under whole-cell voltage clamp from granule cells in slices of rat cerebellum. EPSCs from individual mossy fibre inputs were identified by their all-or-none appearance in response to a graded stimulus. Excitatory synaptic transmission was investigated at room temperature (approximately 24 degrees C) and at near-physiological temperature (approximately 34 degrees C) by analysing current fluctuations in the peak and decay of the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (non-NMDA) component of EPSCs. 2. In a subset of synapses the mean EPSC amplitude remained unchanged as the probability of transmitter release was substantially lowered by raising the extracellular Mg2+ and lowering Ca2+. These synapses were considered to have only one functional release site. Single-site synapses had small EPSCs (139 16 pS, n = 5, at 24 degrees C) with a large coefficient of variation (c.v. = 0.23 0.02, n = 5) and an amplitude distribution that was well fitted by a Gaussian distribution in four out of five cases. The EPSC latency had a unimodal distribution and its standard deviation had a temperature dependence with a temperature coefficient (Q10; range, 24-35 degrees C) of 2.4 0.4 (n = 4). 3. Peak-scaled non-stationary fluctuation analysis of single-site EPSCs indicated that the mean conductance of the underlying non-NMDA channels was 12 2 pS (n = 4) at 35 degrees C. Upper and lower limits for mean channel open probability (Po), calculated from fluctuations in the EPSC peak amplitude, were 0.51 and 0.38, respectively. These estimates, together with the open probability of the channel when bound by transmitter, suggest that only about 50{\%} of the non-NMDA channels were occupied following the release of a quantum of transmitter. 4. At some multi-site synapses EPSCs had a low c.v. (0.4 0.01, n = 5) at 34 degrees C and non-stationary fluctuation analysis gave a parabolic variance-mean current relationship. This suggests that practically all of the non-NMDA receptors were occupied by glutamate at the peak of EPSC. The channel open probability (Po = 0.84 0.03, n = 5) at these 'saturated' multi-site synapses will therefore equal the open probability of the channel when bound by transmitter (Po,max). 5. Non-stationary fluctuation analysis of EPSCs from 'saturating' multi-site synapses indicated that 170 40 postsynaptic non-NMDA channels were exposed to transmitter at the peak of the EPSC. The mean conductance of the synaptic channels was 10 2 pS (n = 5) at 34 degrees C. 6. At synapses with multiple release sites the EPSC decay time became faster when release probability was lowered (by reducing the external Ca2+/Mg2+ ratio), indicating that the transmitter concentration profile depended on release probability. No such speeding of the EPSC decay was observed at single-site synapses. 7. Our results suggest that release of a packet of transmitter from a single release site does not saturate postsynaptic non-NMDA receptors at cerebellar mossy fibre-granule cell synapses. However, at multi-site synapses transmitter released from neighbouring sites can overlap, changing the transmitter concentration profile in the synaptic cleft. We conclude that the level of postsynaptic receptor occupancy can depend on the probability of transmitter release at individual multi-site synapses.},

abstract = {In the CNS, astrocytes are sensory and regulatory hubs that play important roles in cerebral homeostatic processes, including matching local cerebral blood flow to neuronal metabolism (neurovascular coupling). These cells possess a highly branched network of processes that project from the soma to neuronal synapses as well as to arterioles and capillaries, where they terminate in "endfeet" that encase the blood vessels. Ca(2+) signaling within the endfoot mediates neurovascular coupling; thus, these functional microdomains control vascular tone and local perfusion in the brain. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channels--nonselective cation channels with considerable Ca(2+) conductance--have been identified in astrocytes, but their function is largely unknown. We sought to characterize the influence of TRPV4 channels on Ca(2+) dynamics in the astrocytic endfoot microdomain and assess their role in neurovascular coupling. We identified local TRPV4-mediated Ca(2+) oscillations in endfeet and further found that TRPV4 Ca(2+) signals are amplified and propagated by Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release from inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs). Moreover, TRPV4-mediated Ca(2+) influx contributes to the endfoot Ca(2+) response to neuronal activation, enhancing the accompanying vasodilation. Our results identify a dynamic synergy between TRPV4 channels and IP3Rs in astrocyte endfeet and demonstrate that TRPV4 channels are engaged in and contribute to neurovascular coupling.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanism of brain glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier is of importance to understanding brain energy metabolism. The specific kinetics of glucose transport have been generally described using standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics. These models predict that the steady-state glucose concentration approaches an upper limit in the human brain when the plasma glucose level is well above the Michaelis-Menten constant for half-maximal transport, Kt. In experiments where steady-state plasma glucose content was varied from 4 to 30 mM, the brain glucose level was a linear function of plasma glucose concentration. At plasma concentrations nearing 30 mM, the brain glucose level approached 9 mM, which was significantly higher than predicted from the previously reported Kt of approximately 4 mM (p {\textless} 0.05). The high brain glucose concentration measured in the human brain suggests that ablumenal brain glucose may compete with lumenal glucose for transport. We developed a model based on a reversible Michaelis-Menten kinetic formulation of unidirectional transport rates. Fitting this model to brain glucose level as a function of plasma glucose level gave a substantially lower Kt of 0.6 +/- 2.0 mM, which was consistent with the previously reported millimolar Km of GLUT-1 in erythrocyte model systems. Previously reported and reanalyzed quantification provided consistent kinetic parameters. We conclude that cerebral glucose transport is most consistently described when using reversible Michaelis-Menten kinetics.},

abstract = {S100B is an EF-hand calcium-binding protein that exerts both intracellular and extracellular effects on a variety of cellular processes. The protein is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system by astrocytes, both physiologically and during the course of neurological disease. In the healthy adult brain and during development, constitutive S100B expression acts as a trophic factor to drive neurite extension and to referee neuroplasticity. Yet, when induced during central nervous system disease, the protein can take on maladaptive roles and thereby exacerbate brain pathology. Based on genetic and pharmacological lines of evidence, we consider such deleterious roles of S100B in two common brain pathologies: ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In rodent models of ischemic brain damage, S100B is induced early on during the subacute phase, where it exacerbates gliosis and delayed infarct expansion and thereby worsens functional recovery. In mouse models of AD, S100B drives brain inflammation and gliosis that accelerate cerebral amyloidosis. Pharmacological inhibition of S100B synthesis mitigates hallmark pathologies of both brain diseases, opening the door for translational approaches to treat these devastating neurological disorders.},

abstract = {Interactions between separate synaptic inputs converging on the same target appear to contribute to the fine-tuning of information processing in the central nervous system. Intersynaptic crosstalk is made possible by transmitter spillover from the synaptic cleft and its diffusion over a distance to neighboring synapses. This is the case for glutamate, which inhibits gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic transmission in several brain regions through the activation of presynaptic receptors. Such heterosynaptic modulation depends on factors that influence diffusion in the extracellular space (ECS). Because glial cells represent a physical barrier to diffusion and, in addition, are essential for glutamate uptake, we investigated the physiological contribution of the astrocytic environment of neurons to glutamate-mediated intersynaptic communication in the brain. Here we show that the reduced astrocytic coverage of magnocellular neurons occurring in the supraoptic nucleus of lactating rats facilitates diffusion in the ECS, as revealed by tortuosity and volume fraction measurements. Under these conditions, glutamate spillover, monitored through metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated depression of GABAergic transmission, is greatly enhanced. Conversely, impeding diffusion with dextran largely prevents crosstalk between glutamatergic and GABAergic afferent inputs. Astrocytes, therefore, by hindering diffusion in the ECS, regulate intersynaptic communication between neighboring synapses and, probably, overall volume transmission in the brain.},

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) has traditionally been regarded as an inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the CNS in which clinical symptoms result from axon conduction block caused by myelin degradation. However, typical accumulation of permanent neurological deficits during the clinical course of MS cannot be explained solely by de- and remyelinating processes. It is considered to be rather due to neuronal degeneration, for which several reasons could be identified depending on the state of the disease. First, neurons and their axons can be damaged by infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages either directly by cell-to-cell contact or by the release of harmful mediators such as nitric oxide or glutamate. Second, indirect injury to neurons and axons may occur through the loss of trophic support by neighbouring oligodendrocytes due to destruction of both the myelin sheath and the oligodendrocyte itself. Third, redistribution of certain voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels and transporters along naked demyelinated axons restores axonal conduction but also leads to excessive spatially restricted electrical activity of the axonal membrane, intracellular calcium accumulation, impairment of mitochondrial function, and subsequent neuronal degeneration. The neuroprotective potential of pharmacological modulation of these channels and transporters using already approved drugs has been demonstrated in several animal studies, is the subject of current clinical trials and will be the topic of this review.},

abstract = {This study was undertaken to examine the effect of increasing transmural pressure on membrane electrical properties of cat middle cerebral arterial muscle. Middle cerebral arteries were removed from the cat brain, cannulated, and prepared so that transmural pressure within a segment could be manipulated. Intracellular membrane potential was recorded with glass microelectrodes at various transmural pressures. There was a positive slope relating changes in intracellular membrane potential as a function of transmural pressure with a correlation coefficient of 0.79. Blockade of nerve excitation with tetrodotoxin and inhibition of alpha-adrenergic receptors with phentolamine not only did not block the pressure-induced depolarization, but increased the slope of the intracellular membrane potential vs. pressure relationship. This slope was increased upon elevation of extracellular calcium concentration from 2.5 to 4.0 mM and was significantly reduced upon reduction of extracellular calcium concentration to 0.5 mM. When arterial preparations were equilibrated at 0 mm Hg prior to pressurization, action potentials were recorded only when pressure was initially elevated, while a sustained depolarization was recorded during the pressure plateau. However, when arteries were equilibrated at a transmural pressure of 100 mm Hg for 90 minutes, spontaneous action potentials were recorded which increased in frequency as a function of pressure until they were inactivated when intracellular membrane potential approached -30 mV at high transmural pressures. Photomicrographs demonstrated that these vessels either maintained or decreased diameter upon pressurization. These findings provide a cellular mechanism for myogenic regulation of cerebral arterial diameter.},

Incubation for 18 h produced 25{\%} inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase activity. NADH-ubiquinone-1 reductase (complex I) and succinate-cytochrome c reductase (complex II-III) activities were not affected. Prolonged incubation for 36 h gave rise to a 56{\%} reduction of cytochrome c oxidase activity and a 35{\%} reduction in succinate-cytochrome c reductase activity, but NADH-ubiquinone-1 reductase activity was unchanged. Citrate synthase activity was not affected by any of these conditions. The inhibition of the activities of these mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes was prevented by incubation in the presence of the specific nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine.

abstract = {Neuronal stimulation causes approximately 30{\%} shrinkage of the extracellular space (ECS) between neurons and surrounding astrocytes in grey and white matter under experimental conditions. Despite its possible implications for a proper understanding of basic aspects of potassium clearance and astrocyte function, the phenomenon remains unexplained. Here we present a dynamic model that accounts for current experimental data related to the shrinkage phenomenon in wild-type as well as in gene knockout individuals. We find that neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride in passive channels, action of the Na/K/ATPase pump, and osmotically driven transport of water through the astrocyte membrane together seem sufficient for generating ECS shrinkage as such. However, when taking into account ECS and astrocyte ion concentrations observed in connection with neuronal stimulation, the actions of the Na(+)/K(+)/Cl(-) (NKCC1) and the Na(+)/HCO(3) (-) (NBC) cotransporters appear to be critical determinants for achieving observed quantitative levels of ECS shrinkage. Considering the current state of knowledge, the model framework appears sufficiently detailed and constrained to guide future key experiments and pave the way for more comprehensive astroglia-neuron interaction models for normal as well as pathophysiological situations.},

abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that high-viscosity (HV) plasma in extreme hemodilution causes wall shear stress to be greater than low-viscosity (LV) plasma, leading to enhanced production of nitric oxide (NO). The perivascular concentration of NO was measured in arterioles and venules and the tissue of the hamster chamber window model, subjected to acute extreme hemodilution, with a hematocrit (Hct) of 11{\%} using Dextran 500 (n = 6) or Dextran 70 (n = 5) with final plasma viscosities of 1.99 +/- 0.11 and 1.33 +/- 0.04 cp, respectively. HV plasma significantly increased the periarteriolar, perivenular, and tissue NO concentration by 2.0, 1.9, and 1.4 times the control (n = 7). The NO concentration with LV plasma was not statistically different from control. Arteriolar shear stress was significantly increased in HV plasma relative to LV plasma in arterioles but not in venules. Aortic endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) protein expression was increased with HV plasma but not with LV plasma. There was a weak correlation between perivascular NO concentration and the locally calculated shear stress induced by the procedures, when blood viscosity was corrected according to Hct values previously determined in studies of microvascular Hct distribution. The finding that the periarteriolar and venular NO concentration in HV plasma was the same although arteriolar shear stress was significantly greater than venular shear stress maybe be due to differences in vessel wall metabolism between arterioles and venules and the presence of NO transport through the blood stream in the microcirculation. Results support the concept that in extreme hemodilution HV plasma maintains functional capillary density through a NO-mediated vasodilatation.},

Here we provide such a model, that successfully accounts for the main observed changes in blood flow in both visual cortex and somatosensory cortex following their stimulation by high-contrast drifting grating or by single whisker stimulation, respectively. Coupling from glutamatergic synapses to smooth muscle cells of arterioles is effected by astrocytes releasing epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) onto them, following glutamate stimulation of the astrocyte. Coupling of EETs to the smooth muscle of arterioles is by means of potassium channels in their membranes, leading to hyperpolarization, relaxation and hence an increase in blood flow. This model predicts a linear increase in blood flow with increasing numbers of activated astrocytes, but a non-linear increase with increasing glutamate release. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous lipophilic free radical cellular messenger generated by three distinct isoforms of nitric oxide synthases (NOS), neuronal (nNOS), inducible (iNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS). NO plays an important role in the protection against the onset and progression of cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease is associated with a number of different disorders including hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension and diabetes. The underlying pathology for most cardiovascular diseases is atherosclerosis, which is in turn associated with endothelial dysfunctional. The cardioprotective roles of NO include regulation of blood pressure and vascular tone, inhibition of platelet aggregation and leukocyte adhesion, and prevention smooth muscle cell proliferation. Reduced bioavailability of NO is thought to be one of the central factors common to cardiovascular disease, although it is unclear whether this is a cause of, or result of, endothelial dysfunction. Disturbances in NO bioavailability leads to a loss of the cardio protective actions and in some case may even increase disease progression. In this chapter the cellular and biochemical mechanisms leading to reduced NO bioavailability are discussed and evidence for the prevalence of these mechanisms in cardiovascular disease evaluated. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We examined the properties of [Ca(2+)](i) changes that were evoked by backpropagating action potentials in pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices from the rat. In the presence of the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonists t-ACPD, DHPG, or CHPG, spikes caused Ca(2+) waves that initiated in the proximal apical dendrites and spread over this region and in the soma. Consistent with previously described synaptic responses (Nakamura et al., 1999a), pharmacological experiments established that the waves were attributable to Ca(2+) release from internal stores mediated by the synergistic effect of receptor-mobilized inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) and spike-evoked Ca(2+). The amplitude of the changes reached several micromoles per liter when detected with the low-affinity indicators fura-6F, fura-2-FF, or furaptra. Repetitive brief spike trains at 30-60 sec intervals generated increases of constant amplitude. However, trains at intervals of 10-20 sec evoked smaller increases, suggesting that the stores take 20-30 sec to refill. Release evoked by mGluR agonists was blocked by MCPG, AIDA, 4-CPG, MPEP, and LY367385, a profile consistent with the primacy of group I receptors. At threshold agonist concentrations the release was evoked only in the dendrites; threshold antagonist concentrations were effective only in the soma. Carbachol and 5-HT evoked release with the same spatial distribution as t-ACPD, suggesting that the distribution of neurotransmitter receptors was not responsible for the restricted range of regenerative release. Intracellular BAPTA and EGTA were approximately equally effective in blocking release. Extracellular Cd(2+) blocked release, but no single selective Ca(2+) channel blocker prevented release. These results suggest that IP(3) receptors are not associated closely with specific Ca(2+) channels and are not close to each other.},

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) has traditionally been regarded as an inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the CNS in which clinical symptoms result from axon conduction block caused by myelin degradation. However, typical accumulation of permanent neurological deficits during the clinical course of MS cannot be explained solely by de- and remyelinating processes. It is considered to be rather due to neuronal degeneration, for which several reasons could be identified depending on the state of the disease. First, neurons and their axons can be damaged by infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages either directly by cell-to-cell contact or by the release of harmful mediators such as nitric oxide or glutamate. Second, indirect injury to neurons and axons may occur through the loss of trophic support by neighbouring oligodendrocytes due to destruction of both the myelin sheath and the oligodendrocyte itself. Third, redistribution of certain voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels and transporters along naked demyelinated axons restores axonal conduction but also leads to excessive spatially restricted electrical activity of the axonal membrane, intracellular calcium accumulation, impairment of mitochondrial function, and subsequent neuronal degeneration. The neuroprotective potential of pharmacological modulation of these channels and transporters using already approved drugs has been demonstrated in several animal studies, is the subject of current clinical trials and will be the topic of this review.},

Increases in extracellular potassium concentration are known to dilate cerebral arterioles. Recent studies have suggested that the potassium released by active neurons is transported through astrocytic glial cells and released from their endfeet onto blood vessels. The results of computer simulations of potassium dynamics in the brain indicate that the release of potassium from astrocyte endfeet raises perivascular potassium concentration much more rapidly and to higher levels than does diffusion of potassium through extracellular space, particularly when the site of a potassium increase is some distance from the vessel wall. On the basis of this finding, it is proposed that the release of potassium from astrocyte endfeet plays an important role in regulating regional cerebral blood flow in response to changes in neuronal activity.},

abstract = {Optical imaging slit spectroscopy is a powerful method for estimating quantitative changes in cerebral haemodynamics, such as deoxyhaemoglobin, oxyhaemoglobin and blood volume (Hbr, HbO2 and Hbt, respectively). Its disadvantage is that there is a large loss of spatial data as one image dimension is used to encode spectral wavelength information. Single wavelength optical imaging, on the other hand, produces high-resolution spatiotemporal maps of brain activity, but yields only indirect measures of Hbr, HbO2 and Hbt. In this study we perform two-dimensional optical imaging spectroscopy (2D-OIS) in rat barrel cortex during contralateral whisker stimulation to obtain two-dimensional maps over time of Hbr, HbO2 and Hbt. The 2D-OIS was performed by illuminating the cortex with four wavelengths of light (575, 559, 495 and 587 nm), which were presented sequentially at a high frame rate (32 Hz). The contralateral whisker pad was stimulated using two different durations: 1 and 16 s (5 Hz, 1.2 mA). Control experiments used a hypercapnic (5{\%} CO2) challenge to manipulate baseline blood flow and volume in the absence of corresponding neural activation. The 2D-OIS method allowed separation of artery, vein and parenchyma regions. The magnitude of the haemodynamic response elicited varied considerably between different vascular compartments; the largest responses in Hbt were in the arteries and the smallest in the veins. Phase lags in the HbO2 response between arteries and veins suggest that a process of upstream signalling maybe responsible for dilating the arteries. There was also a consistent increase in Hbr from arterial regions after whisker stimulation.},

abstract = {An important concept that has not been sufficiently represented in research into neurodegenerative diseases1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 is the role of the neurovascular unit. The neurovascular unit comprises neurons and non-neuronal cells such as vascular cells (endothelia, pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells) and glia (astrocytes, microglia and oligodendroglia), which could have major roles in disease pathogenesis. These non-neuronal cells form the anatomical, biochemical and immune blood-brain barriers (BBBs) of the CNS and maintain the chemical and cellular composition of the neuronal 'milieu', which is required for proper functioning of neuronal synapses and circuits and for remodeling, angiogenesis and neurogenesis.  A key concern is how we should study neurodegenerative disorders using animal models3. Genetically engineered models of human neurodegenerative disorders in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans have been useful for dissecting basic disease mechanisms and screening compounds. However, in addition to having much simpler nervous systems, non-mammalian species have cerebrovascular and immune systems that differ substantially from those of humans. For instance, the BBB in insects is between the hemolymph and glial cells, and worms do not have a cardiovascular system or BBB. So, genetic models of human diseases in non-mammalian species might not replicate the spectrum of disease pathology found in mammals.},

abstract = {At first sight, the nervous and vascular systems seem to share little in common. However, neural and vascular cells not only are anatomically closely tied to each other, but they also utilize and respond to similar classes of signals to establish correct connectivity and wiring of their networks. Recent studies further provide evidence that this neurovascular crosstalk is more important for understanding the molecular basis of neurological disease than originally anticipated. Moreover, neurovascular strategies offer novel therapeutic opportunities for neurodegenerative disorders. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Nearly 100 years ago Michaelis and Menten published their now classic paper [Michaelis, L., and Menten, M. L. (1913) Die Kinetik der Invertinwirkung. Biochem. Z. 49, 333-369] in which they showed that the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is proportional to the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex predicted by the Michaelis-Menten equation. Because the original text was written in German yet is often quoted by English-speaking authors, we undertook a complete translation of the 1913 publication, which we provide as Supporting Information . Here we introduce the translation, describe the historical context of the work, and show a new analysis of the original data. In doing so, we uncovered several surprises that reveal an interesting glimpse into the early history of enzymology. In particular, our reanalysis of Michaelis and Menten's data using modern computational methods revealed an unanticipated rigor and precision in the original publication and uncovered a sophisticated, comprehensive analysis that has been overlooked in the century since their work was published. Michaelis and Menten not only analyzed initial velocity measurements but also fit their full time course data to the integrated form of the rate equations, including product inhibition, and derived a single global constant to represent all of their data. That constant was not the Michaelis constant, but rather V(max)/K(m), the specificity constant times the enzyme concentration (k(cat)/K(m) × E(0)).},

In untreated cytoplasm taken directly from the giant axon of Myxicola, the migration of Ca was more complex and could not be described by a single diffusion coefficient.

abstract = {A mathematical and numerical model is developed for the adhesion of platelets in stagnation point flow. The model provides for a correct representation of the axi-symmetric flow and explicitly uses shear rate to characterise not only the convective transport but also the simple surface reaction mechanism used to model platelet adhesion at the wall surface. Excellent agreement exists between the analytical solution and that obtained by the numerical integration of the full Navier--Stokes equations and decoupled conservation of species equations. It has been shown that for a constant wall reaction rate modelling platelet adhesion the maximum platelet flux occurs at the stagnation point streamline. This is in direct contrast to that found in experiment where the maximum platelet deposition occurs at some distance downstream of the stagnation point. However, if the wall reaction rate is chosen to be dependent on the wall shear stress then the analysis shows that the maximum platelet flux occurs downstream of the stagnation point, providing a more realistic model of experimental evidence. The analytical formulation is applicable to a large number of two-dimensional and axi-symmetrical surface reaction flows where the wall shear stress is known a priori.},

@article{Dimmeler1999,
abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) produced by the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is a fundamental determinant of cardiovascular homesotasis: it regulates systemic blood pressure, vascular remodelling and angiogenesis. Physiologically, the most important stimulus for the continuous formation of NO is the viscous drag (shear stress) generated by the streaming blood on the endothelial layer. Although shear-stress-mediated phosphorylation of eNOS is thought to regulate enzyme activity, the mechanism of activation of eNOS is not yet known. Here we demonstrate that the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt/PKB mediates the activation of eNOS, leading to increased NO production. Inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase/Akt pathway or mutation of the Akt site on eNOS protein (at serine 1177) attenuates the serine phosphorylation and prevents the activation of eNOS. Mimicking the phosphorylation of Ser 1177 directly enhances enzyme activity and alters the sensitivity of the enzyme to Ca2+, rendering its activity maximal at sub-physiological concentrations of Ca2+. Thus, phosphorylation of eNOS by Akt represents a novel Ca2+-independent regulatory mechanism for activation of eNOS.},

In controls, vibrissae stimulation for 60 s led to a fast (??? 2 s), 17{\%} increase in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the contralateral somatosensory cortex. Systemical (10 mg/kg) as well as topical (10-3 M) application of L-NA reduced the response to stimulation by approximately 50{\%}. Systemical application primarily attenuated the early component of the response, whereas topical application led to an attenuation throughout the whole 60-s stimulation interval.

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) are well established as messenger molecules throughout the body, gasotransmitters, based on striking alterations in mice lacking the appropriate biosynthetic enzymes. Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is even more chemically reactive, but until recently there was little definitive evidence for its physiologic formation. Cystathionine beta-synthase (EC 4.2.1.22), and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE; EC 4.4.1.1), also known as cystathionine, can generate H(2)S from cyst(e)ine. Very recent studies with mice lacking these enzymes have established that CSE is responsible for H(2)S formation in the periphery, while in the brain cystathionine beta-synthase is the biosynthetic enzyme. Endothelial-derived relaxing factor activity is reduced 80{\%} in the mesenteric artery of mice with deletion of CSE, establishing H(2)S as a major physiologic endothelial-derived relaxing factor. H(2)S appears to signal predominantly by S-sulfhydrating cysteines in its target proteins, analogous to S-nitrosylation by NO. Whereas S-nitrosylation typically inhibits enzymes, S-sulfhydration activates them. S-nitrosylation basally affects 1-2{\%} of its target proteins, while 10-25{\%} of H(2)S target proteins are S-sulfhydrated. In summary, H(2)S appears to be a physiologic gasotransmitter of comparable importance to NO and carbon monoxide.},

Interpreted in terms of this model, previous positron emission tomography (PET) studies of the human brain during neural stimulation demonstrating that cerebral blood flow (CBF) increases much more than the oxygen metabolic rate are consistent with tight coupling of flow and oxidative metabolism.

abstract = {Nitrite signaling likely occurs through its reduction to nitric oxide (NO). Several reports support a role of erythrocytes and hemoglobin in nitrite reduction, but this remains controversial, and alternative reductive pathways have been proposed. In this work we determined whether the primary human erythrocytic nitrite reductase is hemoglobin as opposed to other erythrocytic proteins that have been suggested to be the major source of nitrite reduction. We employed several different assays to determine NO production from nitrite in erythrocytes including electron paramagnetic resonance detection of nitrosyl hemoglobin, chemiluminescent detection of NO, and inhibition of platelet activation and aggregation. Our studies show that NO is formed by red blood cells and inhibits platelet activation. Nitric oxide formation and signaling can be recapitulated with isolated deoxyhemoglobin. Importantly, there is limited NO production from erythrocytic xanthine oxidoreductase and nitric-oxide synthase. Under certain conditions we find dorzolamide (an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase) results in diminished nitrite bioactivation, but the role of carbonic anhydrase is abrogated when physiological concentrations of CO2 are present. Importantly, carbon monoxide, which inhibits hemoglobin function as a nitrite reductase, abolishes nitrite bioactivation. Overall our data suggest that deoxyhemoglobin is the primary erythrocytic nitrite reductase operating under physiological conditions and accounts for nitrite-mediated NO signaling in blood.},

abstract = {The oscillatory shear index (OSI) was developed based on the hypothesis that intimal hyperplasia was correlated with oscillatory shear stresses. However, the validity of the OSI was in question since the correlation between intimal thickness and the OSI at the side walls of the sinus in the Y-shaped model of the average human carotid bifurcation (Y-AHCB) was weak. The objectives of this paper are to examine whether the reason for the weak correlation lies in the deviation in geometry of Y-AHCB from real human carotid bifurcation, and whether this correlation is clearly improved in the tuning-fork-shaped model of the average human carotid bifurcation (TF-AHCB). The geometry of the TF-AHCB model was based on observation and statistical analysis of specimens from 74 cadavers. The flow fields in both models were studied and compared by using flow visualization methods under steady flow conditions and by using laser Doppler anemometer (LDA) under pulsatile flow conditions. The TF-shaped geometry leads to a more complex flow field than the Y-shaped geometry. This added complexity includes strengthened helical movements in the sinus, new flow separation zone, and directional changes in the secondary flow patterns. The results show that the OSI-values at the side walls of the sinus in the TF-shaped model were more than two times as large as those in the Y-shaped model. This study confirmed the stronger correlation between the OSI and intimal thickness in the tuning-fork geometry of human carotid bifurcation, and the TF-AHCB model is a significant improvement over the traditional Y-shaped model.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {In spite of intense recent investigation of the physiological and pathophysiological roles of endogenously produced nitric oxide (.NO) in mammalian systems, little quantitative information exists concerning the diffusion of this small nonelectrolyte from its source (NO synthase) to its targets of action. I present here a conceptual framework for analyzing the intracellular and intercellular diffusion and reaction of free .NO, using kinetic modeling and calculations of the diffusibility of .NO and its reactions in aqueous solution based on published data. If the half-life of .NO is greater than approximately 25 msec and the rates of reaction of .NO with its targets are slower than its diffusion or reaction with O2 (for which there is experimental evidence in at least some systems), then (i) .NO acts in vivo in a mostly paracrine fashion for a collection of .NO-producing cells, (ii) .NO diffuses to significant concentrations at distances relatively far removed from a single .NO-producing cell, and (iii) localized sites of vascularization will scavenge .NO (and thus decrease its actions) at distances many cell diameters away from that site. These conclusions have important implications with regard to the mechanism of endothelium-dependent relaxation, the autocrine vs. paracrine actions of .NO, and the role of the spatial relationship between specific sites of .NO formation and neighboring blood vessels in .NO-effected and -affected neuronal signal transmission.},

abstract = {It is well-known that cyclic variations of the vascular diameter, a phenomenon called vasomotion, are induced by synchronous calcium oscillations of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). However, the role of the endothelium on vasomotion is unclear. Some experimental studies claim that the endothelium is necessary for synchronization and vasomotion, whereas others report rhythmic contractions in the absence of an intact endothelium. Moreover, endothelium-derived factors have been shown to abolish vasomotion by desynchronizing the calcium signals in SMCs. By modeling the calcium dynamics of a population of SMCs coupled to a population of endothelial cells, we analyze the effects of an SMC vasoconstrictor stimulation on endothelial cells and the feedback of endothelium-derived factors. Our results show that the endothelium essentially decreases the SMCs calcium level and may move the SMCs from a steady state to an oscillatory domain, and vice versa. In the oscillatory domain, a population of coupled SMCs exhibits synchronous calcium oscillations. Outside the oscillatory domain, the coupled SMCs present only irregular calcium flashings arising from noise modeling stochastic opening of channels. Our findings provide explanations for the published contradictory experimental observations.},

abstract = {Cell-cell communication in astroglial syncytia is mediated by intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) responses elicited by extracellular signaling molecules as well as by diverse physical and chemical stimuli. Despite the evidence that astrocytic swelling promotes [Ca(2+)](i) elevation through Ca(2+) influx, the molecular identity of the channel protein underlying this response is still elusive. Here we report that primary cultured cortical astrocytes express the transient receptor potential vanilloid-related channel 4 (TRPV 4), a Ca(2+)-permeable cation channel gated by a variety of stimuli, including cell swelling. Immunoblot and confocal microscopy analyses confirmed the presence of the channel protein and its localization in the plasma membrane. TRPV4 was functional because the selective TRPV4 agonist 4-alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4alphaPDD) activated an outwardly rectifying cation current with biophysical and pharmacological properties that overlapped those of recombinant human TRPV4 expressed in COS cells. Moreover, 4alphaPDD and hypotonic challenge promoted [Ca(2+)](i) elevation mediated by influx of extracellular Ca(2+). This effect was abolished by low micromolar concentration of the TRPV4 inhibitor Ruthenium Red. Immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy of rat brain revealed that TRPV4 was enriched in astrocytic processes of the superficial layers of the neocortex and in astrocyte end feet facing pia and blood vessels. Collectively, these data indicate that cultured cortical astroglia express functional TRPV4 channels. They also demonstrate that TRPV4 is particularly abundant in astrocytic membranes at the interface between brain and extracerebral liquid spaces. Consistent with its roles in other tissues, these results support the view that TRPV4 might participate in astroglial osmosensation and thus play a key role in brain volume homeostasis.},

abstract = {Fluid shear stress activates the endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) by a mechanism which does not require an increase in the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), and is sensitive to several kinase inhibitors. Although phosphorylation of eNOS has been suggested to regulate enzyme activity, the mechanism of eNOS activation is still unclear. Here we demonstrate that fluid shear stress elicits the phosphorylation of eNOS on tyrosine and serine residues. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), using wortmannin or a dominant negative mutant of its downstream target, Akt (protein kinase B), prevented the maintained serine phosphorylation and activation of eNOS. Enhancing eNOS phosphorylation by inhibiting serine/threonine phosphatases, increased eNOS activity by approximately twofold, as assessed by the accumulation of intracellular cyclic GMP, without increasing the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+. These data suggest that shear stress activates a pathway involving PI3K and the serine/threonine kinase Akt, which phosphorylates eNOS. This phosphorylation directly increases eNOS activity at resting [Ca2+]i, thus rendering the shear stress-induced activation of eNOS apparently Ca2+-independent.},

@article{Lewis1994,
abstract = {An understanding of the rate of reaction of nitric oxide (NO) with oxygen in aqueous solutions is needed in assessing the various actions of NO in the body. A novel approach was developed for studying the kinetics of this reaction, which permitted simultaneous and continuous measurements of the concentrations of NO and the principal product, nitrite (NO2-). Nitric oxide was measured using a chemiluminescence detector, with continuous sampling achieved by diffusion of NO through a membrane fitted into the base of a small, stirred reactor. The results with various initial NO and 0 2 concentrations confirmed that the rate of reaction is second-order in NO and first-order in 0 2 . The rate of reaction of NO was described by the expression 4kl [N0I2[O2], where kl was (2.1 f 0.4) X lo6 M-2 s-1 a t 23 O C and (2.4 f 0.3) X lo6 M-2 s-l a t 37 "C. The value of kl was the same at p H 4.9 and 7.4. The rate of formation of NO2-equaled the rate of reaction of NO (within experimental uncertainty of a few percent), and there was no detectable formation of nitrate (Nos-). This confirmed that NO and NO2-were the only NO, species present in significant amounts and supported the validity of pseudo-steady-state assumptions for NO2 and N2O3, which are intermediates in the conversion of NO to NOa-. A kinetic model was developed to predict temporal variations in the concentrations of NO, 02, NOz-, NO2, and N2O3 in the system studied, which were due in part to transport across the gas-liquid interface and across the membrane a t the base of the reactor. The analysis emphasizes the importance of quantifying interphase mass transfer when studying reaction rates in open systems, a point which has not always been recognized in previous studies with nitric oxide.},

abstract = {Mammalian nitric oxide synthase (NOS), a flavo-hemoprotein, tightly regulates nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and thereby its dual biological activities as a key signaling molecule for vasodilatation and neurotransmission at low concentrations, and also as a defensive cytotoxin at higher concentrations. Three NOS isoforms, iNOS, eNOS and nNOS (inducible, endothelial, and neuronal NOS) achieve their key biological functions by tight regulation of interdomain electron transfer (IET) process via interdomain interactions. In particular, the FMN-heme IET is essential in coupling electron transfer in the reductase domain with NO synthesis in the heme domain by delivery of electrons required for O 2 activation at the catalytic heme site. Compelling evidence indicates that calmodulin (CaM) activates NO synthesis in eNOS and nNOS through a conformational change of the domain from its shielded electron-accepting (input) state to a new electron-donating (output) state, and that CaM is also required for proper alignment of the domains in all the three NOS isoforms. Another exciting recent development in NOS enzymology is the discovery of importance of the FMN domain motions in modulating reactivity and structure of the catalytic heme active site (in addition to the primary role of controlling the IET processes). In the absence of a structure of full-length NOS, an integrated approach of spectroscopic (e.g. pulsed EPR, MCD, resonance Raman), rapid kinetics (laser flash photolysis and stopped flow) and mutagenesis methods is critical to unravel the molecular details of the interdomain FMN/heme interactions. This is to investigate the roles of dynamic conformational changes of the FMN domain and the docking between the primary functional FMN and heme domains in regulating NOS activity. The recent developments in understanding of mechanisms of the NOS regulation that are driven by the combined approach are the focuses of this review. An improved understanding of the role of interdomain FMN/heme interaction and CaM binding may serve as the basis for the design of new selective inhibitors of NOS isoforms. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The cerebrovascular regulation involves highly complex mechanisms to assure that the brain is perfused at all times. These mechanisms depend on all components of the neurovascular units: neurons, glia, and vascular cells. All these cell types can produce nitric oxide (NO), a powerful vasodilator through different NO synthases. Many studies underlined the key role of NO in the maintenance of resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) as well as in the mechanisms that control cerebrovascular tone: autoregulation and neurovascular coupling. However, although the role of NO in the control of CBF has been largely investigated, the complexity of the NO system and the lack of specific NO synthase inhibitors led to still unresolved questions such as the origin of NO and the pathways by which it controls the vascular tone. In this chapter, the role of NO in the regulation of CBF is critically reviewed and discussed in the context of the neurovascular unit and the general principles of cerebrovascular regulation. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The function and efficiency of cell signalling pathways are very dependent on their organization both in space and time. With regard to spatial organization, signalling components are highly organized with respect to their cellular location and how they transmit information from one region of the cell to another. This spatial organization of signalling pathways depends on the molecular interactions that occur between signalling components that use signal transduction domains to construct signalling pathways. Very often, the components responsible for information transfer mechanisms are held in place by being attached to scaffolding proteins to form macromolecular signalling complexes. Sometimes these macromolecular complexes can be organized further by being localized to specific regions of the cell, as found in lipid rafts and caveolae or in the T-tubule regions of skeletal and cardiac cells},
